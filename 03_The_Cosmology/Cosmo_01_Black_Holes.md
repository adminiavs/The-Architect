# Cosmo 01: Black Holes (The Hard Drives of Reality)

## Data Compression
A Black Hole is not a "hole," but the maximum informational density achievable in a region of space. It is a compressed "hard drive" of the universe's state.

## The Holographic Principle
The information of a 3D volume (the interior) is encoded on its 2D surface (the event horizon).
- **Entropy = Area**: The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula ($S \propto A$) proves that reality is fundamentally two-dimensional information projected into 3D.
- **Persistence**: Information is never lost; it is merely scrambled into a highly efficient holographic format.

## Function
Black holes act as the "backup system" for the cosmic lattice, ensuring that the total information content of the universe remains constant.
