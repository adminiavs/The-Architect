# Cosmo 03: The Golden Echo (Gravitational Wave Signatures)

## The Symphony of Space
The Big Bang was not an explosion, but a "tuning" event—the first vibration of the E8 crystal. This event left a permanent resonance in the fabric of spacetime.

## The Signatures
- **Gravitational Waves**: These are the "sound waves" of the crystal.
- **$\phi$ Resonance**: We predict that primordial gravitational waves will show a power spectrum structured around the Golden Ratio ($\phi$).

## Detecting the Architect
By analyzing the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and gravitational wave data, we can "hear" the geometry of the E8 lattice. The "Golden Echo" is the proof that the universe has a specific, non-random fundamental frequency.
