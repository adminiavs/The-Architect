# Cosmology 02 — The Dark Sector (Lambda as Surface Tension)

## Core Principle
Dark energy is not a fluid. It is a boundary condition. Λ behaves as geometric surface tension on the cosmic horizon.

---

## 1. Geometric Definition
The cosmological constant Λ scales as:

Λ ~ 1 / R_H^2

Where `R_H` is the radius of the cosmic event horizon.

This matches observation without invoking vacuum energy densities of `10^120` discrepancy.

---

## 2. Surface vs Volume
Standard QFT assumes vacuum energy scales with volume:

E_vac ~ L^4

Holography replaces this with area scaling:

E_holo ~ L^2

Reduction from `L^4 -> L^2` removes the cosmological constant problem.

---

## 3. Entropic Gravity Coupling
Gravity emerges from entropy gradients:

F = T ∇S

The Dark Sector modifies:
- The entropy gradient
- The temperature (Unruh/Hawking)
- The horizon geometry

This explains cosmic acceleration without dark fluids.

## 4. Matter vs Information Lensing
Bullet Cluster behavior:

- Baryons collide (gas halts)
- Galaxies pass through (collisionless)
- "Dark Matter" signal follows galaxies

In the model, the lensing tracks **information history**, not mass density.

This reproduces the weak lensing maps without WIMPs.

---

## 5. Outcome
Dark Energy:
- Boundary tension
- Holographic bookkeeping

Dark Matter:
- Entropic memory field
- Inertial information storage

Both unified under surface physics.

## 6. The Ratio
The balance between visible matter, dark matter, and dark energy is a geometric necessity of the E8 crystal's expansion phase:
- **Λ**: The energy cost of creating new "pixels" of space
- **Dark Matter**: The geometric "stress" of the lattice

---

## Status
Consistent with:
- ΛCDM at observational scale
- Verlinde's entropic corrections
- Holographic cosmology
- Spectral Action geometry

Falsifiable via:
- halo profiles
- cluster lensing
- cosmic expansion drift
