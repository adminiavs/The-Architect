# Cosmo 02: Dark Sector (Lambda as Surface Tension)

## The Dark Energy Mystery
"Dark Energy" is often modeled as a Cosmological Constant ($\Lambda$). In this framework, $\Lambda$ is the **surface tension** of the cosmic manifold as it expands within the higher-dimensional bulk.

## The Dark Matter Ghost
"Dark Matter" is not a new particle, but the gravitational "echo" or shadow of mass existing in a neighboring "sheet" or fold of the lattice that we cannot directly perceive.

## The Ratio
The balance between visible matter, dark matter, and dark energy is a geometric necessity of the E8 crystal's expansion phase.
- **$\Lambda$**: The energy cost of creating new "pixels" of space.
- **Dark Matter**: The geometric "stress" of the lattice.
