# Mech 04: Relativity Update (Lorentz Invariance as a Deformation)

## The Limit of Light
Einstein's Relativity is correct within its domain, but it assumes a continuous manifold. In a discrete lattice (The Architect's Engine), Lorentz Invariance is an emergent symmetry.

## The Deformation
At extremely high energies (near the Planck scale), the "Speed of Light" is no longer a constant but a variable dependent on the wavelength—a phenomenon known as **Doubly Special Relativity (DSR)**.

- **Non-linear Transformation**: Lorentz transformations are "deformed" to preserve a fundamental length scale (the Planck length).
- **The Limit**: Light does not travel; it propagates through the information density of the lattice.


# Mechanism 04 — Relativity Update

## Core Claim
Relativity is preserved in the infrared but deforms in the ultraviolet due to lattice discretization.

## Lorentz Invariance
Lorentz symmetry is emergent, not fundamental.

At high energies:


E² = p² + m² (1 + η p/Λ)


Dispersion becomes linear with `η ≈ ϕ − 1`.

## Spacetime as Shadow
GR models curvature of the shadow.
The Bulk geometry determines curvature of the projector.

---

## Time
Time is static in the Bulk, dynamical in the Brane.
Traversal creates the illusion of flow.

---

## Einstein’s Role
Einstein found the correct low-energy shadow.
The Architect model defines the geometry casting it.
