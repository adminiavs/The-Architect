# Mech 04: Relativity Update (Lorentz Invariance as a Deformation)

## The Limit of Light
Einstein's Relativity is correct within its domain, but it assumes a continuous manifold. In a discrete lattice (The Architect's Engine), Lorentz Invariance is an emergent symmetry.

## The Deformation
At extremely high energies (near the Planck scale), the "Speed of Light" is no longer a constant but a variable dependent on the wavelength—a phenomenon known as **Doubly Special Relativity (DSR)**.

- **Non-linear Transformation**: Lorentz transformations are "deformed" to preserve a fundamental length scale (the Planck length).
- **The Limit**: Light does not travel; it propagates through the information density of the lattice.
