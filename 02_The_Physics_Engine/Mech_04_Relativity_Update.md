# Mechanism 04 — Relativity Update

## Core Claim
Relativity is preserved in the infrared but deforms in the ultraviolet due to lattice discretization.

---

## Lorentz Invariance
Lorentz symmetry is emergent, not fundamental.

At high energies:

E² = p² + m² (1 + η p/Λ)

Dispersion becomes linear with `η ≈ φ − 1 ≈ 0.618`.

## Spacetime as Shadow
GR models curvature of the shadow.
The Bulk geometry determines curvature of the projector.

---

## Time
Time is static in the Bulk, dynamical in the Brane.
Traversal creates the illusion of flow.

---

## Einstein's Role
Einstein found the correct low-energy shadow.
The Architect model defines the geometry casting it.

## The Deformation (DSR)
At extremely high energies (near the Planck scale), the "Speed of Light" is no longer a constant but a variable dependent on the wavelength—a phenomenon known as Doubly Special Relativity (DSR):

- **Non-linear Transformation**: Lorentz transformations are "deformed" to preserve a fundamental length scale (the Planck length)
- **The Limit**: Light does not travel; it propagates through the information density of the lattice

## The Speed of Light
Einstein: Nothing travels faster than light (c). It takes 8 minutes for light to get from the Sun to Earth.

The Update: Light does not travel. There is no "distance" to cross. The Sun and Earth are entangled pixels on the same screen. The "speed of light" is just the latency or refresh rate of the simulation rendering the image. Information transfer is instant (entanglement), but the "rendering" takes time.
