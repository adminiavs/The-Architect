# Mechanism 01 — Entropic Gravity

## Core Claim
Gravity is not a force; it is the thermodynamic gradient of information stored on the horizon.

---

## Mechanism
Motion toward mass increases horizon entropy. The entropic force arises as:

F = T ∇S

Where:
- `T` = Unruh temperature of the horizon
- `S` = Entanglement entropy

Mass bends the information geometry, not spacetime directly.

## Role of Λ (Cosmological Constant)
Λ is the surface tension of the cosmic horizon. It sets:
- maximum bit count
- maximum radius
- finite complexity of the universe

---

## Difference vs General Relativity
GR: curvature → motion  
Architect: information gradient → curvature → motion

GR describes the shadow. Entropy describes the projector.

---

## Experimental Touchpoints
- Galaxy rotation curves (no DM field required)
- Bullet Cluster (entropic memory tracks collisionless components)
- CMB large-angle anomalies (initial lattice shape)

---

## Historical Context
Following the work of Erik Verlinde, gravity is not a fundamental force but an emergent property of the information encoded on the boundaries of space. Gravity is the "urge" of the system to return to a state of higher informational symmetry.
