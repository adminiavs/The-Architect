# Mech 01: Entropic Gravity (Deriving Newton from Entropy)

## Gravity is an Emergent Phenomenon
Following the work of Erik Verlinde, gravity is not a fundamental force but an emergent property of the information encoded on the boundaries of space.

## The Mechanism
1. **Information Density**: Space is a medium for information.
2. **Entropic Gradient**: When matter moves, it changes the distribution of information.
3. **The "Force"**: The resulting change in entropy creates a displacement that we perceive as gravitational attraction.

## Equation
$$F = m \cdot a \approx \frac{\Delta S}{\Delta x}$$

Gravity is the "urge" of the system to return to a state of higher informational symmetry.
