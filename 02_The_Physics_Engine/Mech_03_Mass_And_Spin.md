# Mech 03: Mass and Spin (The Yukawa/Cosine Map)

## The Origin of Mass
Mass is not an intrinsic property but a coupling constant between a particle and the underlying lattice.

## The Cosine Map
The masses of the elementary particles (leptons and quarks) are not random. They follow a specific "Cosine Map" derived from the angles of the E8 lattice.

- **Yukawa Coupling**: The Higgs field's interaction with fermions is governed by the geometric projection of the E8 symmetry.
- **Spin**: Spin is the internal rotation of information within the lattice cell, quantized by the geometry of the crystal.

## The Formula
$m \propto \cos(\theta_{E8})$
(Simplified representation of the geometric coupling).
