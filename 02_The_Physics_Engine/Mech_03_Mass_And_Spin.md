# Mechanism 03 — Mass and Spin

## Core Claim
Mass and spin originate from the projection of E8 root vectors onto the 4D brane.

---

## Mass (Yukawa Geometry)
In the Bulk:
- all roots have equal length
- no mass hierarchy exists

Mass arises via projection angle:

m_f ∝ cos(θ_f)

Where `θ_f` is the angle between the 8D root and the 4D slice.

Golden-ratio slicing produces exponential suppression across generations.

## Spin
Spinors encode orientation + phase. They are the atomic unit of information.

Spinor = √Vector

Spin-2 (graviton) arises from phason-phonon coupling in the quasicrystal.

---

## Consequence
The hierarchy problem collapses to trigonometry.

The Standard Model constants are geometric, not tuned.

---

## The Cosine Map
The masses of the elementary particles (leptons and quarks) are not random. They follow a specific Cosine Map derived from the angles of the E8 lattice:

- **Yukawa Coupling**: The Higgs field's interaction with fermions is governed by the geometric projection of the E8 symmetry
- **Spin**: Spin is the internal rotation of information within the lattice cell, quantized by the geometry of the crystal
