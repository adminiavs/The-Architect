# The Shadow

## Standard Models and Classical Physics

The "Shadow" represents the established physical theories that the Architect model encompasses and extends. These are the correct low-energy descriptions that emerge from the geometric Bulk.

## Quantum Field Theory (QFT)
The local approximation of the lattice fields.

- Successfully describes electromagnetism, weak, and strong forces
- Predicts particle interactions with extreme precision
- Emerges from the spectral action in the infrared limit

---

## General Relativity (GR)
The large-scale geometric approximation of entropic gravity.

- Correctly describes gravity as spacetime curvature
- Accurate in low-energy, large-scale regimes
- Is the shadow of information geometry, not the source

---

## The Standard Model of Particle Physics
The catalog of particles and forces.

- Three generations of fermions
- Gauge bosons (photon, W, Z, gluons)
- Higgs mechanism for mass

In the Architect model:
- These emerge from E8 → H4 projection
- Mass hierarchy is geometric, not tuned
- Koide ratio is a prediction, not an input

---

## Quantum Mechanics
The framework of probability and measurement.

- Superposition and entanglement
- Wavefunction collapse
- Uncertainty principles

The Architect extends this:
- Collapse is Orch-OR (objective reduction)
- Consciousness is ontic, not emergent
- The Block Universe contains all branches

---

## Thermodynamics
The laws of heat and entropy.

- Energy conservation
- Entropy increase
- Statistical mechanics

The Architect reinterprets:
- Entropy is information bookkeeping
- Gravity is entropic
- Life is negentropy

---

## Status
These theories are not wrong—they are correct within their domains.

They are the projections. The Architect describes the projector.
