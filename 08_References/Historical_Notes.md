# Historical Notes

The Architect model sits at the intersection of several partial revolutions:

---

## 1905–1915 — Relativity
Einstein unifies space, time, and gravity as geometry.

---

## 1920–1965 — Quantum Mechanics
Bohr, Schrödinger, Heisenberg, Dirac unify energy, probability, and measurement.

---

## 1965–1980 — Information Theory & Black Holes
Bekenstein + Hawking introduce entropy into geometry.
Penrose introduces twistor geometry.

---

## 1990–2010 — Holography & Spectral Action
't Hooft, Susskind, Maldacena (Holography).
Connes (Noncommutative geometry).
Hameroff/Penrose (Orch-OR).

---

## 2010–2024 — Complexity & Biology
Quantum biology, coherence, neural synchronization, microtubule research.

---

## 2024–Present — The Architect Synthesis
Final unification of:
- Geometry
- Probability
- Information
- Consciousness
- Cosmology
