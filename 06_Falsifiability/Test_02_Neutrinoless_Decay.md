# Test 02: Neutrinoless Double Beta Decay (Majorana Fermions)

## The Theory
In the Architect's Engine, matter and antimatter are geometric inversions. If the neutrino is its own antiparticle (**Majorana Fermion**), it proves that "mass" is a specific geometric twist that can cancel itself out without external intervention.

## The Test
Search for **Neutrinoless Double Beta Decay ($0\nu\beta\beta$)**.
- **Prediction**: A nucleus decays by emitting two electrons and *no* neutrinos.
- **Significance**: This would prove that lepton number is not conserved and that neutrinos have a Majorana mass term—essential for the E8 symmetry mapping.

## Metric for Correctness
Observation of a peak at the Q-value of the decay in experiments like CUORE, GERDA, or NEXT.

# Test 02 — Neutrinoless Double Beta Decay (Majorana Confirmation)

## Objective
Determine whether neutrinos are Majorana fermions, providing evidence for bulk-leakage seesaw mechanism.

---

## Background
In the Architect model:
- left-handed neutrinos remain on the brane
- right-handed neutrinos leak into the bulk
- bulk scale ~ GUT scale (~10^16 GeV)
- masses satisfy m_ν = m_D^2 / M_R (Type I Seesaw)

Majorana mass implies lepton number violation.

---

## Prediction
Neutrinoless double beta decay (0νββ) must occur.

Decay rate determined by effective mass:

m_ββ ≈ Σ U_ei^2 m_i

Architect mass window:
m_ββ ≈ 10^-2 eV ± order

---

## Experimental Platforms
Search experiments:
- GERDA
- EXO-200
- CUORE
- KamLAND-Zen
- LEGEND
- nEXO
- SNO+

Upgrades bring sensitivity into the predicted window.

---

## Falsification Criteria
Model is falsified if either:

1. 0νββ decay is ruled out down to:
m_ββ < 10^-3 eV

2. Neutrinos confirmed to be purely Dirac

Either outcome breaks the bulk seesaw mechanism.

---

## Confirmation Path
Positive signal establishes:
- Majorana nature
- lepton number violation
- seesaw compatibility
- baryogenesis via leptogenesis pathway

These align with the Architect cosmology.

---

## Status (Current Universe)
No detection yet, but experimental floor approaching Architect prediction band.

Window remains open.
