# Test 02: Neutrinoless Double Beta Decay (Majorana Fermions)

## The Theory
In the Architect's Engine, matter and antimatter are geometric inversions. If the neutrino is its own antiparticle (**Majorana Fermion**), it proves that "mass" is a specific geometric twist that can cancel itself out without external intervention.

## The Test
Search for **Neutrinoless Double Beta Decay ($0\nu\beta\beta$)**.
- **Prediction**: A nucleus decays by emitting two electrons and *no* neutrinos.
- **Significance**: This would prove that lepton number is not conserved and that neutrinos have a Majorana mass term—essential for the E8 symmetry mapping.

## Metric for Correctness
Observation of a peak at the Q-value of the decay in experiments like CUORE, GERDA, or NEXT.
