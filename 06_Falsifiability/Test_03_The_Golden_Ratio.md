# Test 03: The Golden Ratio (Phason Modes in Black Holes)

## The Theory
Quasicrystals (like the projected E8 lattice) exhibit unique degrees of freedom called **Phasons**. These are "flips" in the lattice that do not exist in regular crystals.

## The Test
Analyze the ringdown of merging Black Holes (Gravitational Waves).
- **Prediction**: The "Quasinormal Modes" (the way a black hole "rings" after a merger) will show frequency ratios corresponding to the Golden Ratio ($\phi$) and its powers.
- **Phason Signature**: Small, discrete "jumps" in the gravitational wave phase during the ringdown, representing phason flips in the holographic screen of the event horizon.

## Metric for Correctness
Mechanically verifiable frequency ratios in LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA data matching $\phi \approx 1.618$.
