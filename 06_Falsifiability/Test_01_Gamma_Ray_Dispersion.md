# Test 01: Gamma Ray Dispersion (The Speed of Light Limit)

## The Theory
If spacetime is a discrete lattice (The E8 Crystal), then higher-energy photons should experience a slightly different "speed of light" than lower-energy photons due to the interaction with the lattice pixels.

## The Test
Observe **Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs)** from distant galaxies.
- **Prediction**: Very high-energy photons will arrive slightly after (or before, depending on the deformation model) lower-energy photons from the same event.
- **Status**: Current data from Fermi-LAT and H.E.S.S. show no significant dispersion yet, placing strict bounds on the Planck scale structure. Continued monitoring of higher-energy events is required.

## Metric for Correctness
A statistically significant arrival time delay correlated with photon energy would falsify the continuous manifold model of Relativity.
