# Test 01: Gamma Ray Dispersion (The Speed of Light Limit)

## The Theory
If spacetime is a discrete lattice (The E8 Crystal), then higher-energy photons should experience a slightly different "speed of light" than lower-energy photons due to the interaction with the lattice pixels.

## The Test
Observe **Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs)** from distant galaxies.
- **Prediction**: Very high-energy photons will arrive slightly after (or before, depending on the deformation model) lower-energy photons from the same event.
- **Status**: Current data from Fermi-LAT and H.E.S.S. show no significant dispersion yet, placing strict bounds on the Planck scale structure. Continued monitoring of higher-energy events is required.

## Metric for Correctness
A statistically significant arrival time delay correlated with photon energy would falsify the continuous manifold model of Relativity.

# Test 01 — Gamma-Ray Dispersion (Lattice Pixelation Test)

## Objective
Determine whether spacetime exhibits Planck-scale discretization consistent with a 4D E8 quasicrystal lattice.

---

## Background
In the Architect model, spacetime is not a smooth continuum; it is an aperiodic lattice. High-energy photons interact differently with this lattice than low-energy photons.

The prediction: energy-dependent time-of-flight delay.

---

## Prediction
Arrival time delay scales linearly with photon energy:

Δt = η · (ΔE / M_P) · D

Where:
- Δt = arrival time difference
- ΔE = photon energy spread
- M_P = Planck mass
- D = source distance (cosmological)
- η = structural constant of the lattice

Architect intrinsic prediction:
η ≈ φ − 1 ≈ 0.618

Tolerance:
±0.005

---

## Experimental Platforms
Suitable observational platforms:
- Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope
- MAGIC Telescope
- CTA (Cherenkov Telescope Array)
- HESS
- LHAASO
- GRB detectors at cosmological redshift

Ideal sources:
- GRB 090510 type short bursts
- Blazar flares (TeV scale)
- AGN jets

These events emit simultaneous photon pulses across large energy bands.

---

## Falsification Criteria
The model is falsified if:
1. η << 0.1 (no detectable dispersion)
2. η >> 1.0 (non-physical scaling)
3. dispersion is quadratic or higher-order (n > 1)

Success range:
η ≈ 0.618 ± 0.005

---

## Status (Current Universe)
Present data pushes η ~ O(1) at Planck scale.

Model remains viable pending CTA and LHAASO upgrades.

---

## Notes
This test distinguishes between:
- continuum spacetime (GR & QFT baseline)
- loop quantization (n = 2 quadratic)
- causal dynamical triangulation (piecewise smooth)
- quasicrystal discretization (n = 1 linear)

This is the cleanest “kill switch” test.
