# Question 01: Fine Tuning

## The Problem
Why are the physical constants of the universe so precisely tuned to allow for the existence of complexity and life?

## The Architect's Hypothesis
Fine-tuning is not a coincidence but a geometric necessity. In the E8 lattice, only specific ratios (like the Golden Ratio $\phi$) allow for stable, non-repeating structures. Complexity is an emergent property of the lattice's inherent symmetry.

# Fine-Tuning (Geometric vs Coincidental)

Traditional physics treats ~20 Standard Model parameters as arbitrary. In the Architect model, these are geometric.

Open questions:

---

## 1. Slice Orientation
The Yukawa hierarchy depends on the irrational slice through E8.

Unknown: Can orientation be derived from symmetry-breaking instead of assumed?

---

## 2. Coupling Unification
Spectral Action predicts unification at warped scale.

Unknown: Is the warp factor determined uniquely by Λ?

---

## 3. Cosmological Constant
Λ interpreted as surface tension of the horizon.

Open: Does this derive from G2 torsion, or from boundary condition?

---

## 4. Neutrino Sector
Seesaw mechanism consistent, but mass ordering unresolved.

Question: Normal or inverted hierarchy?

---

## 5. Dark Sector Minimalism
Do MOND-scale anomalies require no dark particles, or a minimal sterile component?
