# Question 01: Fine Tuning

## The Problem
Why are the physical constants of the universe so precisely tuned to allow for the existence of complexity and life?

## The Architect's Hypothesis
Fine-tuning is not a coincidence but a geometric necessity. In the E8 lattice, only specific ratios (like the Golden Ratio $\phi$) allow for stable, non-repeating structures. Complexity is an emergent property of the lattice's inherent symmetry.
