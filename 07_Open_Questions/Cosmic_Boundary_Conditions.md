# Cosmic Boundary Conditions

The Architect model uses a Block Universe with fixed initial and final boundary conditions.

Open questions:

---

## 1. Initial Condition Geometry
Known: Initial lattice derives from E8 quasicrystal projection.

Unknown: Which slice orientation through E8 is realized?

---

## 2. Final State Compactification
Hypothesis: Universe ends in topological unwinding (return to trivial vacuum).

Question: What is the minimal Hilbert-space configuration satisfying 0 → 1 → 0?

---

## 3. Horizon Limits
Open: Is the cosmological horizon hard (finite Hilbert space) or soft (renormalizing with Λ)?

---

## 4. Residual Entropy
Unknown: Does the universe complete cancellation at zero entropy, or saturate at a low but non-zero value?

---

## 5. Inflation Constraints
Observation: Radion inflation sets the scalar tilt n_s.

Unknown: Exact number of e-folds set by boundary entropy bound.

---

## 6. The Edge of the Gem
What defines the "surface" of the E8 crystal?

Is there an "Outside" to the informational bulk?
