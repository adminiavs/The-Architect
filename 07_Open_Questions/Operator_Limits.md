# Operator Limits (Constraints of the Observer)

Conscious traversal through a static lattice raises constraints on what can be experienced.

Open inquiries:

---

## 1. Traversal Speed
Question: Is there a maximum rate at which the observer-cursor can traverse Hilbert space?

Candidate: Gamma-band synchrony (~40 Hz) as biological clock.

---

## 2. Branch Exclusion
Constraint: Observer cannot traverse states that violate global unitarity.

Interpretation: Everett branches may exist mathematically but not phenomenologically.

---

## 3. Decoherence Budget
Open variable: How much entropy can an observer tolerate before trajectory degrades?

Related: Aging as decoherence accumulation.

---

## 4. Collapse Latency
Unknown: What is the delay between superposition resolution and conscious awareness?

---

## 5. Cognitive Degrees of Freedom
Question: Does consciousness scale with microtubule count, network topology, or coherence length?

---

## 6. The Boundaries of Agency
What are the physical limits of constructive interference (manifestation)?

Does the "Block Universe" allow for actual choice, or only the perception of it?
