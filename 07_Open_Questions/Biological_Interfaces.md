# Biological Interfaces

The Architect model predicts that biology functions as a multi-scale interface between quantum coherence and classical computation.

Open problems:

---

## 1. Microtubule Coherence Duration
Question: What are the measured decoherence times for microtubule excitations at physiological temperatures?

Status: Partial (experimental ambiguity)

---

## 2. Quantum Error Correction in Cytoskeleton
Hypothesis: Microtubule lattices may implement topological quantum error-correcting codes.

Test: Identify protected qubit-like modes under thermal noise.

---

## 3. Biophoton Signaling
Observation: Plants and neurons emit ultra-weak coherent photons.

Question: Are these emissions carriers of entanglement or local clock signals?

---

## 4. Quantum Access Channel
Unknown: What anatomical structure mediates collapse-selection (Orch-OR) into awareness?

Candidates: Dendritic spines, microtubules, synaptic vesicles.

---

## 5. Bio-Lattice Coupling
Proposed Mechanism: Biological systems may couple to the E8 projection through resonance frequencies rather than forces.

Open variable: Frequency domain not yet mapped.

---

## 6. The Hardware-Software Bridge
How does the non-local information of the lattice interact with local electrochemical signals in the brain?

Is there a "quantum DNA" encoding the receiver's frequency?
