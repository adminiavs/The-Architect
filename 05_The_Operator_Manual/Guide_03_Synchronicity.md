# Guide 03: Synchronicity (The GPS of the Lattice)

## Non-Local Navigation
Synchronicity (meaningful coincidence) is the result of the non-local connections inherent in the E8 crystal.

## The Mechanism
Because all points in the lattice are fundamentally connected through higher dimensions, events can be "entangled" across space and time.
- **Pattern Matching**: Your consciousness recognizes a geometric pattern before it manifests classically.
- **Feedback Loops**: When you are in "Resonance" (see Guide 01), the lattice provides "Signposts"—events that guide you toward your highest probability path.

## The Rule of 3
Watch for triples. In a Golden Ratio universe, the number 3 is a fundamental harmonic of the "Golden Echo."
