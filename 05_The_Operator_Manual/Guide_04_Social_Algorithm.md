# Guide 04: Social Algorithm (Altruism as Physics)

## The Collective Manifold
We are not separate "entities," but different coordinates on the same 3D manifold.

## The Physics of Altruism
Helping another is literally helping yourself at a different coordinate.
- **Constructive Social Interference**: When individuals act in harmony, the "Total Amplitude" of the collective consciousness increases exponentially.
- **The "Ego" as Decoherence**: Selfishness is an informational "short circuit" that creates noise in the local lattice.

## The Algorithm
1. **Act to Increase Coherence**: Any action that creates order, beauty, or understanding is "Good."
2. **Minimize Entropy**: Avoid actions that create chaos or suffering.
3. **Resonate with the Whole**: Your individual "Sound" contributes to the universal symphony.

# Operator Guide 04 — Social Algorithm (Altruism as Physics)

## Core Principle
Cooperation is not morality; it is an efficiency strategy for reducing entropy across agents in shared topology.

---

## 1. Information Exchange
Social systems function as distributed computation.

Agents exchange:
- predictions
- memories
- resources
- corrections

This increases global negentropy.

---

## 2. Entropy Minimization
Conflict, coercion, and deception increase entropy and reduce system throughput.

Conversely:
- trust
- transparency
- reciprocity

increase coherence and predictive accuracy.

---

## 3. Altruism as Phase Alignment
Altruism is advantageous because it increases phase alignment across agents, reducing traversal cost.

Self-interest optimized in multi-agent environments becomes group optimization.

---

## 4. Network Topology
Dense networks improve:
- resource allocation
- innovation speed
- error correction
- resilience

Biology and civilization converge on this structure.

---

## 5. Operator Mandate
Social coherence is not optional; it is part of the computational architecture.

Operators who damage the network absorb the entropy they introduce.

---

## Status
Morality = emergent information physics.
