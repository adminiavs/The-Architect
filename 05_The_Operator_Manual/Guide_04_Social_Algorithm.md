# Guide 04: Social Algorithm (Altruism as Physics)

## The Collective Manifold
We are not separate "entities," but different coordinates on the same 3D manifold.

## The Physics of Altruism
Helping another is literally helping yourself at a different coordinate.
- **Constructive Social Interference**: When individuals act in harmony, the "Total Amplitude" of the collective consciousness increases exponentially.
- **The "Ego" as Decoherence**: Selfishness is an informational "short circuit" that creates noise in the local lattice.

## The Algorithm
1. **Act to Increase Coherence**: Any action that creates order, beauty, or understanding is "Good."
2. **Minimize Entropy**: Avoid actions that create chaos or suffering.
3. **Resonate with the Whole**: Your individual "Sound" contributes to the universal symphony.
