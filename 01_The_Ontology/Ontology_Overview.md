# Ontology Overview

## The Hierarchy

Level | Domain | Description
----- | ------ | -----------
0 | Source | Zero, symmetry, silent
1 | Bulk | E8 × E8 geometry (static)
2 | Projection | Cut-and-project mechanism
3 | Physics | Entropic + Spectral actions
4 | Biology | Coherence + negentropy
5 | Consciousness | Collapse + traversal
6 | Purpose | Error correction + cancellation

## Ontological Rules

1. Nothing is emergent — only revealed.
2. Nothing is created — only selected.
3. Nothing is lost — only scrambled.
4. Nothing is infinite — only unbounded.
5. Time does not pass — you move.

## Minimal Summary
Reality is a finite, static, geometric object.
Consciousness is the traversal across that object.
Physics is the bookkeeping of the traversal.
