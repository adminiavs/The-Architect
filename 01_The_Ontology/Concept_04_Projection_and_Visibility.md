# Concept 04 — Projection and Visibility

## Core Claim
What exists in the Bulk ≠ what is visible in the Brane.

---

## Projection Filters
Three filters determine what becomes physical:

1. **Dimensional Filter**
   - 11D → 4D slice

2. **Angular Filter**
   - Bulk vectors → projection angles → Yukawa couplings

3. **Coherence Filter**
   - Only coherent states remain stable enough to be observed

---

## Consequence
Most of the Bulk is not “hidden matter.”
It simply doesn’t project with enough coherence to survive in spacetime.

This reframes “Dark Matter” and “Dark Energy” as visibility and tension problems, not substance problems.
