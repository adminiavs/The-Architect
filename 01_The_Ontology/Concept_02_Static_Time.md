# Concept 02: Static Time (Block Universe vs. Flow)

## The Illusion of the "Now"
Human perception treats time as a flowing river, a sequence of events moving from past to future. However, physics suggests a "Block Universe" where all time—past, present, and future—exists simultaneously as a static 4D structure.

## The Geometry of Time
In the Architect's framework, time is a spatial dimension that we traverse at a fixed rate. There is no "becoming," only "being."

- **The Record**: Every moment is a fixed coordinate in the lattice.
- **The Playback**: Our consciousness acts as the needle on a record player, moving along the pre-existing grooves.

## Implications
If time is static, causality is a local interpretation of a global geometric symmetry. Destiny is not "written" in the future; it is the geometric necessity of the whole structure.


# Concept 02 — Static Time

## Core Claim
Time does not flow. The Universe is static. “Becoming” is traversal through a completed geometric object.

## Block Universe (Einstein’s Insight)
General Relativity already implies:
- Past, present, future all exist simultaneously
- The flow of time is perspectival

The Model accepts this and extends it:
Time is not a dimension of change; it is a dimension of address.

## Traversal
A conscious observer is a cursor that scans across the static geometry.

Traversal generates:
- memory (past)
- anticipation (future)
- measurement (present)

## Implication
Physics does not evolve.
You evolve across physics.

The film is already recorded. You are walking the reel.
