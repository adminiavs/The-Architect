# Concept 02: Static Time (Block Universe vs. Flow)

## The Illusion of the "Now"
Human perception treats time as a flowing river, a sequence of events moving from past to future. However, physics suggests a "Block Universe" where all time—past, present, and future—exists simultaneously as a static 4D structure.

## The Geometry of Time
In the Architect's framework, time is a spatial dimension that we traverse at a fixed rate. There is no "becoming," only "being."

- **The Record**: Every moment is a fixed coordinate in the lattice.
- **The Playback**: Our consciousness acts as the needle on a record player, moving along the pre-existing grooves.

## Implications
If time is static, causality is a local interpretation of a global geometric symmetry. Destiny is not "written" in the future; it is the geometric necessity of the whole structure.
