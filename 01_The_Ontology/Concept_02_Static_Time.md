# Concept 02 — Static Time

## Core Claim
Time does not flow. The Universe is static. "Becoming" is traversal through a completed geometric object.

## Block Universe (Einstein's Insight)
General Relativity already implies:
- Past, present, future all exist simultaneously
- The flow of time is perspectival

The Model accepts this and extends it:
Time is not a dimension of change; it is a dimension of address.

---

## Traversal
A conscious observer is a cursor that scans across the static geometry.

Traversal generates:
- memory (past)
- anticipation (future)
- measurement (present)

## The Vinyl Record Analogy

- **The Record**: Every moment is a fixed coordinate in the lattice
- **The Needle**: Your consciousness moves along the pre-existing grooves
- **The Music**: Experience arises from the traversal, not from the record changing

---

## Implication
Physics does not evolve.
You evolve across physics.

The film is already recorded. You are walking the reel.

---

## Causality
If time is static, causality is a local interpretation of a global geometric symmetry. Destiny is not "written" in the future; it is the geometric necessity of the whole structure.
