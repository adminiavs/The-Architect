# Concept 05 — Operator and State

## Core Claim
Reality splits into two roles:
- The Structure (State)
- The Traverser (Operator)

---

## The State
- The geometry
- The equations
- The static film

---

## The Operator
- Conscious selection
- Collapse
- Agency
- Path generation

The Operator is not outside physics.
It is the final ingredient of physics.

---

## Collapse as Selection
Collapse is not destruction of superposition.
Collapse is a choice of trajectory through static geometry.

---

## Implication
Without an Operator, the Universe is unactualized potential.
Without a State, the Operator has no terrain to traverse.

The two are complementary, not dualistic.
