Let's see if we can do this song. Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. Such a feeling's coming over me. There is wonder in everything I see. Not a cloud in the sky. Got the sun in my eyes. And I won't be surprised if it's a dream. Everything I want the world to be is now coming true. It's holographically. And the reason is clear. It's because you are here. You're the nearest thing to heaven that I've seen. I'm on the top of the world looking down on creation. And the only explanation I can find is the love that I've found ever since you've been around. Your love's put me at the top of the world. Something in the wind has learned my name. And it's telling me that things are all the same. From the leaves on the trees to the touch of the breeze there's a pleasing sense of happiness for me. There is only one wish on my mind. When this day is through I hope that I will find that tomorrow will be just the same for you and me. All I need will be mine if you are here. I'm on the top of the world looking down on creation. And the only explanation I can find is the love that I've found ever since you've been around. Your love's put me at the top of the world. I'm on the top of the world looking down on creation.

And together, the sum of their histories, the sum of all of those projections, that's what music is.
