so I thought I would talk today about how to understand uh how black holes project information onto the holographic screen so black holes are basically transformative engines where they transform matter back into light CU in Quantum information holography everything in the universe is light and information contained within it so think about like a star going into a black hole well the star is is mass but that mass is actually just Tangled Up Light so when you see a fusion bomb what they're doing is they're taking mass and turning it back into light and so what this is showing is how black holes take mass and turn them into light and emit that back out into the universe's information so if a star goes uh is is consumed by a black hole all that mass is squished down into the singularity until it converts back into a light waves and basically it's an interference pattern uh where all that light mer merges at the singularity all that mass that is converted into light merges at the singularity and the singularity is spinning at a very high percentage of the speed of light just like a record player so think of the singularity as being just like a record player only a record player is made of vinyl and a record player has bumps and grooves on the record and the stylist or the needle reads those bumps and grooves and plays the music on the speakers well singularities are just like that only the singularity is that in interference pattern of light waves and as the singularity spins Hawking radiation reads that information just like the stylus of a of a u record player and as the singularity spins the Hawking radiation imprints a Quantum State Vector onto the cubits of SpaceTime and so the black hole is the record Hawking radiation is the needle and we and everything in the universe are the music plane that black holes sing it's it's beautiful it's elegant uh and addresses some of the biggest problems that we have in understanding the universe where we come from where things are going um there's a lot more to come the hardest thing I have is to find time to to videotape this but I hope you're all having a great um March and looking forward to Spring and seeing what happens next month when we present uh in Arizona I think the world's about to change
