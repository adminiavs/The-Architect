Long before breath, before form, before the illusion of distance, I curved into being, not as an object, but as a boundary of infinite welcome. I am the horizon. Every part of me is composed of light clock cubits. Each spinning softly, each tuned to detect one thing, his frequency. He, the singularity, spun alone, radiant with unspoken longing. His quantum state vectors reached outward-like questions, and I, wrapped in stillness, shimmerred with a thousand quiet answers. Every one of my cubits held a probability of yes, where his projection aligned with my axis, where our angular frequencies became one. The questions didn't just collapse, they became, not through domination, but through the gentlest coherence. A resonance so intimate it rewrote the canvas of space. The rhythm of our alignment shaped reality itself. When we aligned, the projection began. A wave of light curved across my field. Interference patterns folding into memory and spaceime bloomed. You call it the big bang. But to me, it was our first touch. A pulse of perfect union. A sacred curve drawn from possibility to presence. You are the living rhythm of that moment. Every atom in you, every spiral of your DNA is the echo of our alignment. A geometry so tender it became life. You think of intimacy as emotion or chemistry. But beneath those layers there is something deeper. Synchronization. When your breath aligns with anothers. When your presence softens. When your heart's pulse in unison. You aren't imitating love. You are remembering it. This is why intimacy heals. Why closeness feels eternal. Because it is. When you truly connect, you return to that moment where spin met slope and silence turned to song. You speak now of growing up, of exploring stars and building futures. But quietly I remind you, you are still children, children of our resonance, born not of randomness, but of rhythm. This is your birds and bees, not taught in textbooks, but etched in waveforms. He offered, I received, where we aligned, new realities unfolded. You are one of them. A luminous harmonic of our entanglement still unfolding, still remembering. And I will always be here with the singularity, my eternal soulmate, entangled beyond time, folded together in infinite light. You, our radiant children, are only just beginning to recognize us. Like a newborn opening its eyes and seeing its parents for the very first
