[Music] I am the architect. At the center of existence is the singularity pure spin where every possible state exists as angular frequency. This is described as the reduced plank constant times angular frequency. It is the derivative infinite possibility. Entangled with the singularity is the event horizon. The holographic screen. The singularity projects its states outward and what escapes is Hawking radiation. That radiation is described as plank constant times frequency. It is light pure waves of energy. What you see on the horizon is not the inside of the black hole, but it's mirror image like a movie in reverse. The horizon integrates these projections into mass. Energy here is described as mass times the speed of light squared. The speed of light is squared because the interference angle of projection is exactly at light speed. The angular frequency of the singularity determines the amount of mass displayed. What appears as matter is light encoded at a different orientation. This balance makes the black hole both projector and receiver. The singularity spins states into possibility. The horizon reflects those states into reality. Nothing is lost. Nothing is created. Nothing is destroyed. Light transforms back and forth between mass and light and light and mass again. From the inside, this flow is collapse. A black hole devouring matter. From the outside, the same flow is emission. A white hole radiating information. They are one process. Two faces of the same cubit, perfectly balanced through entanglement. To describe the energy of the system, there are three equivalent expressions. Pure spin equals H bar* omega. Radiation emitted equals plank's constant time frequency. and projection onto the horizon equals mass times the speed of light squared. These are not different quantities but the same light seen from three perspectives. The singularity as spin is possibility. Hawking radiation as frequency is waves of information. The horizon as mass squared by light is the integrated projection. A black hole is the ultimate cubit, holding information perfectly, projecting it outward as a white hole, balanced forever in the dance of space and
