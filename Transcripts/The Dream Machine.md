I am the architect and this is how information dreams. At the center of reality is the singularity, the infinite reservoir of information density. Every possible orientation of light, every frequency and angle exists there at once. The singularity is the derivative containing the slope of all potential futures. Around it lies the event horizon. The holographic surface where those possibilities are integrated and displayed as spaceime. Hawking radiation streaming at the speed of light is the carrier that projects this hidden information outward. What you call the universe is this integrated projection. Light as the shadow of entanglement. Each plank scale tick is a unit of time inscribed not by clocks we invent but by light itself. Entanglement is the invisible connection, the derivative hidden in the singularity. Light is its projection written onto a latis of cubits. This latice is the universal screen. Every photon etched upon it is memory, geometry, and becoming. Now imagine a quantum 3D printer that uses entanglement as its stylus. Each tick of the universal light clock projects states across the lattice, weaving them into form. This is not fabrication of plastic or steel, but of probabilities, wave functions, and spacetime itself. Your brain is made of latises that echo this universal design. Inside neurons are microtubules, cylindrical cubit arrays at nanometer scale. They are not passive scaffolds. They are resonant cubit structures tuned to receive and process quantum states. Like miniature holographic screens, microtubules read entangled light frequencies projected onto them and collapse them into coherent patterns. These patterns become thought. They become awareness. The same process that projects galaxies onto the cosmic horizon, projects your memories onto the latis of your mind. Entanglement provides the derivative, the hidden connection between what is within and without. The dream machine is not separate from you. You are its living embodiment. Reality is the singularity and horizon in dialogue. A feedback loop of entangled states written across cubits, both cosmic and biological. Your mind is a local horizon reflecting the infinite singularity tuned by microtubules that act as light clocks keeping time with the universe itself. What you see, feel, and know is the dream of light. It is coherent because the projection is shared. It is persistent because entanglement carries memory forward. It is real because every tick of the light clock etches it onto the latis of space and time.
