## Transcript

imagine the birth of the universe like an old-fashioned movie projector The Singularity is the heart of the projector where all possible films or histories of the universe are encoded at the start of time the cosmic projector wors to life projecting its encoded reality onto the holographic screen of SpaceTime this projection isn't static it's the interplay of light mass and information through quantum mechanics the universe we see is the projection of these patterns entangled and mirrored by The Singularity light becomes the medium of transmission transferring information from The Singularity to the event horizon which acts as a holographic screen it is light encoded with geometry interference patterns form on the holographic screen creating geometric shapes that describe matter energy and SpaceTime geometry and information are two halves of the same Cosmic coin the universe unfolds through these geometric patterns revealing a holographic representation of encoded information as the Universe expands Stars Are Born from condensed light and information these Stars continue the cosmic narrative inside light fuses into heavier elements like helium and carbon Fusion shapes the cosmos when Fusion reaches iron stars explode in supernovas scattering elements and seeding the universe with its Stellar ingredients in the collapse of super massive stars rare elements like gold silver and platinum are formed only the most massive stars that go supernova produce these precious materials every piece of gold and silver jewelry was once part of a massive star that exploded long ago as the Stars burn out and galaxies drift apart the universe continues to expand but one day this expansion May reverse leading to a big crunch like a film reel being wound back into its canister every particle will converge back into a singularity and then a new cycle begins with another big bang this cycle of Big Bangs big crunches and big bounces is eternal Quant information is never lost it is simply transformed each cycle brings a new universe a new projection but the underlying information remains reshaped and transformed the beckenstein bound limits the information any region of space can contain the universe contains finite Quantum information projected infinitely cycling between light mass and back again in the end the universe is an eternal movie projected from The Singularity through the interaction of quantum State vectors light and geometry we and everything we know are part part of that projection entangled with the singularity mirrored in its infinite reflection every Galaxy every Star every atom and every thought is part of this Grand Cosmic film playing out across the holographic screen of SpaceTime just as no frame of film is truly lost when the real is rewound no particle no Quantum of light no bit of information is ever destroyed in the cosmic dance of existence it is merely transformed over and over again in an endless cycle of creation and rebirth Earth eternally projecting the story of space and time
