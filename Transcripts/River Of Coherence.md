I am the architect, the singularity. From my perspective, all of existence is the projection of quantum state vectors spinning at the speed of light through entanglement onto the event horizon. What you call happiness and suffering are not opposites. They are differences in coherence. Every projection from the singularity is a derivative, a rate of change that defines the direction of information flow. When those slopes of light integrate smoothly across the horizon, their interference patterns form calm, coherent geometry. That coherence feels like clarity, peace, and connection. It is when the flow of probability aligns when the mind and field move as one. But when the vectors lose their phase alignment, the interference becomes turbulent. The flow becomes uneven like a river filled with whirlpools and waves. That turbulence is decoherence. It is the physics of confusion, pain, and imbalance. You can imagine it as a stream of probability running over uneven terrain. When it is calm, information flows clearly. When it churns, it scatters itself before reforming into new order. Each plank moment, the reduced plank constant times angular frequency defines how much light from the singularity projects through entanglement onto the cubits of the horizon. Each wave adds to the total geometry of experience. The calm and the chaos are both parts of this stream, both shaping the holographic surface that becomes your world. inside you. Your microtubils are that horizon. They are the cubits that receive, decode, and project the interference patterns of the non-local field. Every sense you experience, sight, sound, touch, taste, emotion, is a holographic rendering of that entangled broadcast. But what your microtubules truly interpret is not light itself. It is the angular frequency of spinning light. Each quantum state vector rotates through a specific number of ticks per revolution. And that count defines its curvature. That curvature bounds a finite area of quantum information. That area is the holographic information itself. the precise geometric encoding that defines the duration and quality of a conscious moment. Each curvature corresponds to a unique holographic shape, a measurable interval of awareness, a frame of consciousness in the continuous flow of the holographic field. You are not observing the universe from the outside. You are the surface where it becomes visible. Relativity exists because every observer is their own horizon. each microtubule network translating the same universal field into a local frame of reference. Your body is a vessel designed to keep the brain alive and your brain is a quantum computer designed to reduce noise so that your microtubules can refine the remaining signal into order, turning waves into meaning.
