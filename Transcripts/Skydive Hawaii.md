So don't you trade on me, cause I will knock you down. Todays it seems it's not worth it, cause I will knock you down. So don't you trade on me, cause I will knock you down. If it's gonna be slowly, so don't you trade on me, cause I will knock you down. Todays it seems it's not worth it, the fight against is all gone. I'm not trying to make you win, we just need one damn thing done. Before I lose control, I'm getting myself on the phone. Before you're born into me, there is a possibility, you better turn that thing around. If it's gonna be slowly, so don't you trade on me, cause I will knock you down. Never come a day that I saw you, consequently I could never leave you. The shatter of those living battleships, the love that you knew. I'm ready for the fall, I'm better than steel, I'm as feeble as I'm not you. Oh, there's a clock in my head, despite what it said. When I'm away you're gone. I need a break, something to stop you said. Teeny people counting the dead. A break from all the sadness is what I need now, yeah. I've been naked and at loss for words. Apathy, a sense in the hood. Automatic senseless, no questioning it. And what's the point of nothing so dull? You're ever on your feet, enlightened entirely. Just think about it. And what's the point of nothing so slight? You're ever on your feet, enlightened entirely. Just think about it. Ask me, I'm not blind. I can't, I can't read all the signs. So many have died. So many out of their minds. Thank your lucky stars. You've got it good, it's not hard to be what you are. Thank your lucky stars. Thank your lucky stars. We're in a place I thought we'd never get. People involved and fought for their bread. But you've got no power going to get out of it. It's a mistake to be paranoid. Mental state that takes strength to avoid. All the hostility and fear should be challenged. And what's the point of living that way? So many close their minds to what others say. Whichever feeling you voice. And what's the point? We're gonna pay. So that our work, work or not, we'll all have their day. So make your choice. Ask me, I'm not blind. I can't read all the signs. So many have died. So many out of their minds. Thank your lucky stars. You've got it good, it's not hard to be what you are. Thank your lucky stars. Thank your lucky stars. Thank you for being us all. It's like a pain locked in a part of your heart. That's never gonna leave unless you stop to warm it up. Be wise and be smart. Out on the ocean, there's no one around, no one to hear your sound. It's just us out here. Out on the ocean, we can breathe. Away from the city, away from the ears that bug us, and judge us, it's so liberating to be free. And my heart slows down. Nice and easy, and your breathing will be pleasing. Just be easy, and say what's on your mind. I search for something to compare you to. The long and hard are all similarly true. And I'm suddenly aware. In the quest, you'll be one of the best. Just be easy. Oh, look at that. That's it. Perfect job. Thank you.
