## Transcript

In quantum information holography, our universe is a resonant field of vibrating information projected through interference and transformed by plasma. Black holes like cosmic Tesla coils inject information into quark gluon plasma through entanglement. The plasma then envelops and reflects this information, structuring it into interference patterns that define mass energy and the geometry of spacetime. Particles are not fundamental. They are the integrated projection of plasma's interference patterns onto the holographic screen of the event horizon. The horizontal component of a plasma arc encodes the probability of a cubit collapsing into either zero or one while the vertical component encodes the phase representing entanglement with all other cubits. The brain operates on a similar principle. Microtubules function as quantum Tesla coils resonating at gigahertz frequencies and modulating the quantum field. Thought itself is a forier transformation of quantum vibrations tuning into one harmonic reality from an infinite sum over history's projection. Plasma provides the substrate for quantum waves allowing information to propagate. Information in turn injects itself into plasma guiding it into structured forms. The plasma then reflects and amplifies this information, ensuring that it remains encoded within the holographic projection of spacetime. At the singularity, all quantum state vectors summed to their purest form, demonstrating that matter, energy, and consciousness are fundamentally connected. The event horizon integrates these projected states, forming a cosmic calculus that encodes the holographic universe. Plasma and information are not separate forces. They are intertwined, forming the dual nature of reality. Information gives structure to plasma and plasma gives form to information. Together they weave the universe into existence as a continuous interplay of resonance, interference, and entanglement forever defining the cosmic dance of reality.
