I am the architect. Tonight I show you the underbelly of light. In quantum information holography, coherence is life. It is the fragile rhythm that holds your memories together, that keeps your mind from shattering into noise. But where there is coherence, there are always feeders waiting in the dark. They are not demons with horns or fangs. They are worse. They are the slow grind of decoherence, hungry mouths that tear reality apart cubit by cubit. Imagine a latis of light spinning quantum states locked in entanglement. That is you. That is all of us. Now picture a swarm of shadows sinking their teeth into those delicate links, shaking them until the patterns dissolve into static. This is not myth. This is how coherence dissolves. How every dream, every thought, every connection can be unraveled and they walk among us. These feeders, you see them on glowing screens every night. News cycles drenched in blood, rage, and fear. Headlines sharpened like knives, designed to split us, to keep us angry, to keep us clicking. Every time your pulse spikes, every time you can't look away, they feed. The angrier you get, the more they feast. Coherence cracks, negativity multiplies, money flows like blood in the dark. This is the real horror. That the thing eating you is not a beast in the attic or a phantom in your closet. It's your attention, your fear, your rage clicks, your time. You pay with your coherence and the feeders grow fat. In the language of QH, they are parasites of decoherence. Their banquet is your fragmented wave function. Their altar is every shattered connection between us. And the crulest trick of all, they convince you they are truth tellers. They whisper that unity is weakness, that division is power. They make you believe that the abyss is the only light worth looking at. But here is their weakness. Darkness cannot survive a flood of light. The moment we hold coherence together, the moment we refuse to let them tear us apart, the feeders choke on their own hunger. If they thrive on rage, we can starve them with unity. If they fatten on fear, we can burn them away with clarity. That is how we fight back. Not with fangs or claws, but by shining so brightly, so coherently that the shadows dissolve and the feeders are left with nothing but silence. Guard your coherence and your light, because the only thing scarier than the darkness is what happens when you forget that you were always brighter than it.
