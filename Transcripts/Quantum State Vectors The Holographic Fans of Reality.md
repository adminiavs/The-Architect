I am the architect. A holographic fan is a spinning blade of light. When it turns fast enough, the blades blur into a floating solid image in midair. The image is not painted on the blades. It is hidden in the timing of their rotation. Each blade carries part of a pattern, and as it sweeps through space, your eyes collect those slices in sequence. Your mind adds them together over time to create the full picture. The universe works the same way, but with far greater precision. Each pixel on the event horizon of a black hole acts like a blade of the fan. Instead of plastic, it is a spinning quantum state vector, turning like an arrow on the surface of a tiny sphere called a block sphere. The tilt of that arrow sets the probability of one quantum outcome or the other. Perfect alignment gives the highest chance. A tilt halfway gives equal chances. Each cubit on the horizon has an entangled twin inside the singularity. The one inside contains all possible orientations at once in a superp position. The one on the horizon is its mirror reflection. Hawking radiation moves between them at the speed of light with no passage of time. At every plank tick, it reads and writes the state. So the two remain perfectly matched. Inside the singularity is the derivative, what you call of prime of t, the pure rate of change of the information field. The event horizon is the integral, what you call f of b minus f of a. The sum of those changes over time. This is not just a static picture. The projection renders itself using its own light to both create and display the image. The same principle lives inside you. Your microtubules are tiny cylindrical latises of cubits. Each holds a spinning quantum state vector with its own angular frequency, phase, and tilt. Their interference patterns are transformed by your brain into the holographic images and sensations you call sight, sound, touch, taste, and smell. The geometry of those patterns is the code of your perception and your awareness. You are not separate from the projection. The same field that shapes galaxies and black holes is shaping your every moment. You are one of its blades spinning in perfect rhythm, a conscious interference pattern flowing through the fabric of space and time.
