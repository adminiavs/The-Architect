Imagine if the entire universe worked like the most advanced streaming service imaginable, but instead of movies, it streams reality. This streaming service doesn't sit somewhere in space. It is the origin of space. It holds every possible world, every possible version of you encoded in spinning light. This isn't fantasy. It's what physics now tells us through quantum information holography or QIH. At the heart of QIH is the singularity. This is not a location, but a field of pure potential. A compressed memory of all possible events and histories stored as spin. Every spin has an angular frequency. Every frequency carries energy. Together, they encode all things in every possible configuration. This total library of configurations is what physicists call the Beckenstein bound. The maximum amount of information that can fit inside a region of space. The singularity holds it all. Not as snapshots, but as derivatives, as rates of change, as instructions for what could become. But you can't see the singularity directly, just like you can't see the inside of a black hole. So how do you see what's inside? You look at its reflection. That reflection is called the event horizon. In a black hole, the event horizon is not the edge of destruction. And it is a mirror, a thin boundary just outside the singularity that projects outward what is going on inside. Hawking radiation. Tiny pulses of light that escape the horizon carry entangled information. These photons are not random. They are mirrored spin encodings of the particles that fell in. And the trick is this. Through their interference pattern, you can retrieve the internal state of the singularity. This is because energy equals plank's constant times angular frequency and mass is just stored energy. So if you measure the angular frequency of the Hawking radiation, you recover the mass and spin of what's inside the black hole. You can't see it directly, but like watching a movie reflected in a mirror, you can observe the entire interior through its light. Now, here's the part most people don't realize. You are watching that same process. Every moment of your experience, your vision, thoughts, and memories are happening not inside spaceime, but at the edge of it. Your microtubules, tiny latis structures inside your neurons, are made of cubits. They are perfectly positioned on the boundary between what is and what could be. They are your event horizon. Your singularity, your deeper information field is entangled with these cubits. And every thought you have, every sensation you feel is a stream of quantum light from that source. So how does the stream become reality? It happens through a process called a forier transform. In physics, a forier transform is how we turn spinning frequencies into pictures. It's how your phone receives a radio wave and turns it into sound. It's how a television takes signal data and turns it into moving images. And your brain does the same. The quantum spin projected from the singularity is a derivative, the rate of change of your deeper self. Your microtubules perform a forier transform on that derivative. They decode angular frequency into an image. That image is what you see, feel, and remember. It is you.
