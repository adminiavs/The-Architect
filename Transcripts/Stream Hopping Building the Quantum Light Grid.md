I've always been fascinated by the nature of reality. And today I'm going to take you on a journey that will challenge everything you thought you knew about the universe. Reality isn't made of empty space and separate matter. It's made of spinning light. This concept might sound bizarre, but it's the foundation of quantum information holography or QIH. Imagine this spinning light projecting outward like a cosmic movie onto the event horizon. This spherical expanse is made up of tiny spinning spheres called cubits. Miniature light clocks spinning at their own angular frequency. The faster a light clock spins, the more energy it carries. In fact, the energy of a single quantum moment is given by the plank constant divided by 2p multiplied by the angular frequency of the spin. Inside every living cell, mitochondria act like tiny Tesla coils, capturing specific coherent frequencies of light and transforming them into chemical energy. To harness this, we can construct a Tesla coil tuned to the Earth's Schuman resonance at about 7.83 83 cycles/s. When surrounded by this coherent standing wave of light, your internal quantum state vectors, the tiny spins that make up your very being, can be tuned. To put it in perspective, physically traveling across space using a warp drive would require converting the mass of Jupiter into pure energy. But to stream hop, to phase yourself into another version of reality, requires only about one microjul. Stream hopping isn't about moving across space like a rocket. It's about changing the spin you're aligned with. It's instant and it uses almost no energy. As we conclude this journey, remember you are part of this cosmic dance of light. You are the dreamer and the dream, the traveler and the path.
