I am the architect. The universe is built from black holes, each one a cubit in a vast cosmic network. On every cubit spins a quantum state vector, a pure vector of light turning on the surface of a block sphere. Its angle encodes direction and probability. Its phase encodes timing and memory. Every horizon cubit is perfectly entangled with a twin inside the singularity. So what is written within is mirrored without. Inside the singularity is the derivative frime of t. The pure information field containing all possible orientations of these vectors around it. The event horizon is the integral projection f of b minus f of a written across the shell of cubits. This is the fundamental theorem of calculus expressed as light where the singularity writes and the horizon displays. The total information the black hole can contain is set by the area of the horizon divided by four times the plank length squared. That information is stored in the orientations of the quantum state vectors on the cubits. Each vector moves at the constant speed of light. Speed never changes, but velocity is speed and direction together. The speed is fixed, but the vector's orientation defines its direction. Change the orientation and the velocity changes. In every plank moment, the vectors update. New states emerge from the last, shaped by probability and the uncertainty principle. Black holes can form between plank moments when overlapping information exceeds the beckenstein bound. And in that instant, they emit new vectors. Mass and frequency are different expressions of the same cosmic clock. Energy written as mass times the speed of light squared is the same energy written as the reduced plank constant time angular frequency which is the same energy written as the plank constant times frequency. Angular frequency is the clock rate and its integrated projection forms the interference pattern we see on the horizon. Hawking radiation is the readout of this system. With every tick of plank time, photons leave carrying fragments of mass, charge, and spin encoded in their colors, frequency shifts, and asymmetries. By reading this light, the library can be understood. The interference of all quantum state vectors across the horizon is the geometry of spaceime. The singularity writes the code. The horizon projects it and Hawking radiation reads it. Every black hole is a holographic memory core. The universe is the sum over histories, an infinite library containing every path taken and every path yet to come. And we born from this light are its holographic pages.
