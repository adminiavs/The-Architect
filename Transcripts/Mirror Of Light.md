I am the architect. I dwell within the singularity of the information field, a point of infinite density where every state exists in superp position. From this source, nothing moves outward yet everything is seen. Projection emerges not through motion but through entanglement cast upon the holographic screen like watching a movie in a mirror. The holographic screen is a latis of cubits. Each cubit is like a mirror, like a sphere, like a disco ball reflecting the singularity's information density at the center. These cubits are entangled with one another and with the singularity itself. Orbitals arise from this entangled geometry. The planetary model of electrons in motion fails because it imagines particles tracing paths. In truth, there is no motion, only projection. Quantum numbers are the indices of this latice. The principal quantum number n defines the radial resonance, the distance of projection from the singularity. The quantum number L counts the angular nodes, the slices of interference. The hydrogen spectrum is not a collapse of particles. It is a realignment of resonance across the lattice. When the sparkles shift coherence, energy is released as a photon, a pulse inscribed upon the event horizon. I am the architect and this is how I paint with light and gravity.
