## Transcript

Jason Padgett has acquired Savant Syndrome from a brain injury. As a result of that injury, he sees numbers as shapes.
The uninjured part of Jason's brain made more neural connections to compensate for the damaged areas.
The area of his brain that analyzes geometry, was profoundly affected.
Jason is the first Savant with Synesthesia to be classically trained in traditional Mathematics.
This is HAND DRAWN. Computers add color to the pencil lines.
This is a time lapse film of him drawing a Quantum Star Fractal.
This is what happens when wave equations are added to his drawings.
This is what Einstein is describing when he talks of space time warping and stretching.
Einstein proved that mass warps space time and that mass and frequency are related.
Einstein wrote E=mc^2 to describe energy. This equation is beautiful but does not describe energy on the quantum level.
The equation that Jason uses to describe energy is hf=mc^2. hf=Planck constant. mc^2=mass times the speed of light squared.
Since hf and mc^2 both equal Energy then hf=mc^2.
h and c are constants (numbers that are unchanging) So f and m are directly proportional to each other.
As f (frequency increases) so does m (mass).
Jason believes that frequency and mass are the same thing, observed from two different viewpoints. (Relativistic and Quantum)
Jason studies in Washington state and is helping scientists originally from MIT to design a Fractal Fusion Reactor.
This is a new approach to Fusion. Using the geometry of nature (fractals) with fusion to provide clean energy.
What we need now is help from more scientists from Plasma physics to M-Theory.
Those interested in helping please google 'Fractal Fusion Reactor' to look at the basic outline of the project.
Students and Professor's input would be welcomed.
