black holes are like vinyl records or the laser discs of the universe they encode data imagine the light of the universe any light that goes into that black hole uh it starts going around it's in a ring because it gets captured and that information is encoded into the photon sphere of a black hole now if you think of a black hole as a laser disk or as a record player each black hole has a certain topology imagine it's kind of like a disco ball or a geodesic with little facets and every black hole spins and has different amounts of facets and different amounts of information and different rates of Spin and as it is spinning Hawking radiation which behaves like a record player needle or the laser on a laser disc the Hawking radiation is reading the topology of the spinning black hole and here we have the grid-like structure of space-time and as that needle that is reading the topology from the photon sphere of the black hole is red it imprints that data as oscillations at the speed of light directly into the structure of space-time and when you turn now when we see that oscillation from it reading the light needle reading the Hawking radiation and printing it onto the screen if we turn and we look at the screen this way the Planck lattice you'll see that those oscillations because of the degrees of freedom that the plane collatus allows causes constructive interference head on where the oscillations have traveled the exact same distance in the exact same amount of time and they constructively interfere with each other head on at the speed of light that is equals mc squared that is why C is squared and equals mc squared
