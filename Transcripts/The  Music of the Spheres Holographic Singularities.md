at the heart of every black hole hidden beyond the reach of time and space is the singularity a point where everything collapses into one but this isn't an empty void according to Quantum information holography The Singularity is an ultimate projector of existence the origin of all Reflections yet bound inseparably to the event horizon singularities and their Horizons are entangled bound together in a dance of mirrored light where each reflects the other like two sides of a cosmic coin Imagine The Singularity as the universe's primordial light a source projecting encoded information outward in Quantum information holography this projection isn't a one-way path every Photon every bit of data that the singularity emits is met by The Event Horizon a holographic screen woven from countless block spheres each of these block spheres is like a mirror capturing and refracting the singularities information and projecting it back the event Horizon doesn't just display reality it participates in it creating a feedback loop this is entanglement in its purest form where the singularity and the Horizon are more than connected they are perfect reflections of each other projecting existence through an eternal exchange the block spheres forming the Event Horizon each hold Unique Reflections encoding different histories and infinite possibilities together they create a cosmic Mosaic a record of what has been and a map of what could be each block sphere is a universe in miniature Bound by entanglement as the singularity sends out its light each block sphere refracts this in a slightly different angle in qih gravity emerges not as a traditional Force but as the curvature of information the natural shape forms through the constant entanglement between the singularity and the Event Horizon each block sphere on the horizon captures and shifts with each new bit of information this contributes to the gravitational gradient that forms space-time structure as observers in this universe we live within one of these encoded Reflections each of us every atom and every particle are reflections on the Event Horizon if you could stand on the edge of the Event Horizon you would see yourself reflected across infinite block spheres every choice every possible life path is encoded within one of these spheres The Event Horizon isn't just a boundary it's a self-contained Cosmos where all versions of reality exist in qih the cycle of projection and reflection is eternal universes collapse and then reemerge forever locked in Cosmic reflection each new universe is a fresh projection but one that reflects an altered reality the cosmic holographic memory is preserved and imprinted as encoded information on the horizon the universe speaks to itself with each mirror echoing we are light we are information and we are here
