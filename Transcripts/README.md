# Transcripts — Source Material

This directory contains the original explanatory transcripts that formed the foundation of The Architect model. These are raw conversational explorations of concepts, mechanisms, and principles.

---

## Purpose

The transcripts serve as:
- **Source documentation** for the formal model
- **Alternative explanations** in conversational style
- **Exploratory thinking** before formalization
- **Context and backstory** for concept development

---

Transcripts vary in format:
- Some are polished expositions
- Some are conversational exchanges
- Some include music lyrics or cultural references
- Some have no file extension (legacy format)

All content is preserved as originally created to maintain authenticity and context.

## Relationship to Formal Model

The formal model documents (in folders 00-08) are distilled, structured, and verified versions of concepts first explored in these transcripts. 

When formal documents seem terse, the transcripts often provide expanded context, analogies, and alternative framings that aid understanding.
