## Transcript

imagine you're standing on the shore watching the waves roll in each wave that reaches you is shaped by everything that came before it the wind the pull of the moon the currents of the ocean the patterns in the water are both simple and complex each Ripple carrying the story of how it was formed now think of this ocean as the fabric of the universe and instead of waves of water imagine waves of light and information in Quantum information holography or qih we can think of reality as being made up of waves of information just like those waves in the ocean these waves don't just move through space they form the very fabric of space itself and they encode everything we know the Stars the trees even our own thoughts at the smallest level everything is connected by a web of information that behaves like a Quantum program traditionally computers work by flipping switches between zero and one like lights turning on and off but in qih the code of the universe doesn't just rely on simple onoff States instead it uses a kind of superposition a blend of possibilities it's as if the universe is running a Quantum program where all possible realities exist at once and the one we experience is just one version of that grand super position now let's connect this with something more tangible imagine you're flipping a light switch in your home in regular Computing it's either on or off like a regular light but in Quantum Computing and in the way the universe operates according to qih that light can be both on and off at the same time in a super position even more fascinating the very Act of flipping the switch creates a kind of pattern just like the waves in the ocean and this pattern encodes information but here's the Magic in qih we don't just use zeros and ones to describe reality instead the information of the universe is encoded in the very geometry of space every angle every curve every shift in space and time carries data the way these waves of light and information interact creates a pattern that tells the story of the universe in this way writing a code with superpositions of zeros and ones is the same as shaping the geometry of space itself it's like saying that reality in its deepest Essence is a Quantum program where geometry and information are two sides of the same coin the patterns we see from the waves in the ocean to the stars in the sky are all part of this Grand Quantum Code a code written in the very shape of space and time in this story we aren't just observers we're participants in a grand Cosmic program shaped by the waves of information that Ripple through the universe each of us in a way is part of this holographic code written in the geometry of existence itself thank you for joining me in this journey into the Quantum Code of the universe if you enjoyed this exploration make sure to like share and subscribe for more fascinating insights until next time stay curious
