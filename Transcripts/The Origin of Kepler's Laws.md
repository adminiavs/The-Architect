the mystery of motion why do planets orbit the Sun in such Perfect Harmony why do they speed up near the Sun and slow down farther away Johannes Kepler described these patterns over 400 years ago with three laws but what causes those paths Quantum information holography reveals the true origin it shows that planetary motion isn't pulled like a stone on a string it is the result of spinning light encoded as Quantum State vectors projected from a singular ity onto the fabric of SpaceTime in qih the universe is built from Tiny spinning arrows of light called Quantum State vectors or qsvs each qsv spins on a Quantum axis and contains four key pieces of information first its amplitude How likely it is to appear second its angular frequency how fast it spins which determines its energy third its wave Vector its direction of motion across space and fourth its phase its timing in the rhythm of the universe all of this is is encoded in a universal wave expression we say the amplitude time e to the I multiplied by the wave Vector do position minus angular frequency times time plus the phase these spinning qsvs form the holographic tensor field of the universe Kepler's first lore ellipses The Sun and planets exchange spinning light they become entangled projecting into each other across the fabric of space the result a curved projection an ellipse this shape isn't random it's the interference pattern of two entangled qsv Fields so Kepler's first law the elliptical orbit comes from geometry of entangled light kept as second or equal areas in equal time as a planet orbits it sweeps out equal areas in equal time this happens because of the conservation of angular momentum in qih this means when the planet moves closer to the Sun the distance shrinks to conserve momentum the spin rate or angular frequency increases faster spin me means faster motion spoken naturally the equation is angular momentum equals mass * radius s * angular frequency so motion is faster when spin is tighter encoded by qsvs Kepler's thirdd Law time and radius now let's talk about the time it takes to orbit Kepler found that the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the Orbit's radius this means as radius increases the curvature of the qsv field decreases with less curvature spin rate slows down the orbit takes longer to complete this isn't about Force it's about geometry the curvature of spinning light all of this is made possible by one foundational truth sin^2 theta plus cosine 2 Theta = 1 this isn't just trigonometry in qh sin squ represents constructive interference when qsvs align cosine squar represents destructive interference when they cancel out together they always add up to one the total conserved energy or the speed of light in natural units this identity guarantees that all the light spinning on cubits always balances the universe never loses or gains energy it simply redistributes its rhythm in Einstein's theory time slows down near gravity in qih we see the same but through spin each qsv acts as a light clock spinning at angular frequency as spin increases time slows the QI version of the time dilation formula is elapse time equals original time divided by theare < TK of 1us spin rate squar it's geometry time curves as light spins in quantum mechanics every possible path is included in the final result in qih every spinning qsv adds to the final hologram the master equation is reality equals the sum of all amplitudes time e to the I multiplied by the wave Vector position minus spin rate time time plus phase each spinning Arrow of Light contributes to your reality these are aren't just ideas they're measured through cern's mun experiments showing time dilation through NASA's orbital data matching angular momentum through gravitational wave detections from ligo through quantum entanglement black hole Hawking radiation and atomic clocks let's sum it up planets move in ellipses because light interferes they speed up and slow down because qsv spin is conserved the orbital time relates to radius because of spin curvature time itself is made of spin the identity s^ squ plus cosine squ equal one is the rule of balance that makes the entire Cosmos possible this isn't a metaphor it is spinning light and geometry this is reality and kepers laws projecting the holographic script of the universe
