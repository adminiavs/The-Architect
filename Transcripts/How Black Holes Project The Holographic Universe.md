there's one other thing I really wanted to tell you guys about that that's going to make it much easier to understand how when I'm talking about these little spinning of bits of Hawking radiation or Quantum State Vector spinning how that actually does make a hologram and uh so there's something called holographic fans and I'll attach uh something down in the comments about this um or like a video of it where you have these fans just like a regular fan that blows air on you but on the fan there's little LED lights that flash at the the right frequency and as those fans spin it becomes a hologram and so when I'm talking about SpaceTime being a projection a holographic projection it's basically showing that these Quantum State vectors which are just light Hawking radiation which is light as they're spinning they're doing the exact same thing that these holographic fans are doing they create a holographic image they also describe curvature uh gravity velocity and probability because they're Quantum State vectors but when it comes to just visually looking at them they literally are the same thing or or very similar to holographic fans the only difference is is that they are the plank length they're super super tiny so the universe by projecting this hologram with Quantum State vectors is literally making the most highdef holographic screen that is possible within the laws of physics and so when you when you see that video that I'm going to post down there of the holographic fans just imagine SpaceTime on each little Cubit is a spinning bit of Hawking radiation which is light and it builds a holographic image just like the video you're going to watch uh in the comments about the holographic fans only it's much higher definition
