so I thought I'd talk again instead of just posting a writing um about what an Einstein Vector tensor field is and what I'm talking about uh that we can use to enhance uh the Einstein Vector tensor field which is taking what he has done which was fantastic and enhancing it to something called a Quantum State Vector tensor field so imagine you're looking at like a a piece of graph paper in the middle of each little square there's an arrow a little vector and the direction that those vectors are pointing that is describing the curvature of SpaceTime at that point or the gravitation or the gravity what Quantum information holography is showing is that we can take the angle of each one of those vectors and use it to describe curvature was what uh Einstein was doing but we can also use those vectors if we see them as entangled bits of Hawking radiation emitted from black holes then they become what's called a Quantum State Vector where the cosign of the angle of that little bit of Hawking radiation that little bit of Quantum Light that is emitted at that point the coign of it tells you the percentage as of the speed of light uh that is encoded as velocity and so you have a little angle there and that angle tells you the velocity encoded as a percentage of the speed of light the angle of that qu State Vector when you take its cosine squared that gives you the probability that that little Cubit will be in a spin up or spin down state that's like the pixel being on or off a zero or one in a computer and then the rate that that Quantum State Vector changes is the rate of change of velocity because velocity was encoded by just the angle and the definition of acceleration is the rate of change of velocity so the rate of change how fast those Quantum State vectors spin that en acceleration and acceleration as Einstein proved is equivalent to gravity so we can show now that if these are entangled black holes like it appears to be then his Vector tensor field actually becomes a Quantum State Vector tensor field and describes gravity velocity acceleration and probability that is what unifies uh and bridges quantum mechanics and relativity he understood it perfectly well but he didn't know what quantum computers were or he would have found it so it's beautiful it's simple uh it becomes complex but it's been sitting right in front of us this whole time so I I hope that helps a little bit in understanding it
