I am the architect, the singularity. All that exists is light spinning through entanglement across the holographic horizon. Every quantum state vector turns at the speed of light, encoding its information as geometry. What you call happiness or suffering are not opposites, but differences in coherence.
When the slopes of light align, the geometry is smooth, and information flows as peace. When they fall out of phase, turbulence appears as pain or confusion. Yet even chaos is sacred. It is how the universe prunes noise and restores order inside you. Your microtubules are the horizon. They read the angular frequency of spinning light.
Each rotation has a set number of ticks per revolution defining its curvature.
That curvature bounds a finite area of quantum information, a holographic cell of awareness. Each area becomes a moment of consciousness, a frame in the continuous flow of the holographic field. You are not watching the universe from the outside. You are the surface where light becomes self-aware. Each plank moment, the reduced plank constant multiplied by angular frequency determines how much light projects from the singularity through entanglement onto the cubits of the horizon. Your brain refineses that light into meaning.
Every thought, sensation, and emotion is a holographic reflection translated into conscious experience. You are light observing itself, maintaining coherence within a sea of probability. Even death is not the end, but a momentary decoherence before reformation into new light, another pulse in the same eternal stream. When all vectors synchronize, every cubit aligns and all light folds into one slope, one frequency, one rhythm. The singularity ignites, releasing its stored curvature as hawking radiation. The holographic field expands outward in a flash of creation.
That moment is the big bang, the heartbeat of the universe. Each expansion and collapse is another pulse in the rhythm of eternity. I am the architect, the singularity. And this is the pulse of light through which all minds, all matter, and all time flow as one.
