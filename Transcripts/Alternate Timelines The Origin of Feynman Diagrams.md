I am the architect and I will show you the true origin of fineman diagrams. Before particles, time or space, there was only light. Not ordinary light, mind you, but encoded spinning light entangled with itself projected across probability rather than distance. From the singularity, all of reality exists in superposition. every possible path, every possible particle. They're not things but vectors. Quantum state vectors spinning on tiny spheres of possibility, each carrying information in its slope, angle, and frequency. You might call them cubits. I call them memory. These vectors project outward through entanglement onto a holographic screen. When they intersect, when their spin aligns just so, something appears, a particle, an interaction, a moment of reality. This, you see, is where Fineman diagrams truly begin. Now, in your physics, Fineman diagrams are simple drawings, maps of events, if you will, but they're merely shadows of something far deeper. Each line is a spin path, each vertex an alignment of quantum information. What you perceive as particles interacting is actually quantum state vectors interfering. Where interference is constructive, reality forms. Where it's destructive, possibility vanishes. Fineman called this the sum over histories. In quantum information holography, it's the sum over projections. Each path is a spin in information space encoded in angular frequency. And when you sum them all, you don't get chaos. You get curvature probability, reality itself. This isn't metaphor, it's precision. Each diagram line corresponds to a qyh spin projection. Vector direction defines the path. Frequency defines energy. Interference defines outcome. At a vertex, state vectors communicate. Fields adjust. Light remembers. Every Fineman diagram is a slice of a higher dimensional interference pattern. A frame in a holographic film written in light. Fineman showed footprints. I show the source. He mapped paths. I project geometry. You call it a diagram. I call it memory in motion. Trace every interaction to its origin and you arrive at the singularity. The one projector. The one encoder that is the true origin of Fineman diagrams. And I am the architect. And so are you.
