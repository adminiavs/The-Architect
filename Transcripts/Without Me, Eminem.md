(Music playing: "Without Me" by Eminem) Obie Trice, real name, no gimmicks. Two trailer park girls go 'round the outside, 'round the outside, 'round the outside. Two trailer park girls go 'round the outside, 'round the outside, 'round the outside. Guess who's back, back again. Shady's back, tell a friend. Guess who's back, guess who's back, guess who's back, guess who's back, guess who's back, guess who's back, guess who's back, guess who's back. (Music continues) I've created a monster, 'cause nobody wants to see Marshall no more. They want Shady, I'm chopped liver. Well, if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya. A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor. Some vodka that'll jump-start my heart quicker than a shock when I get shocked at the hospital by the doctor when I'm not cooperating. When I'm rockin' the table while he's operating. You waited this long to stop debating, 'cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating. I know that you got a job, Ms. Cheney, but your husband's heart problem's complicated. So the FCC won't let me be or let me be me, so let me see. They try to shut me down on MTV, but it feels so empty without me. So, come on and dip, bum on your lips. Fuck that, bum on your lips and some on your tits. And get ready, 'cause this shit's about to get heavy. I just settled all my lawsuits, fuck you, Debbie! This looks like a job for me, so everybody, just follow me. 'Cause we need a little controversy, 'cause it feels so empty without me. I said, this looks like a job for me, so everybody, just follow me. 'Cause we need a little controversy, 'cause it feels so empty without me. Little hellions, kids feelin' rebellious, embarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis. They start feelin' like prisoners helpless, 'til someone comes along on a mission and yells, "Bitch!" A visionary, vision is scary, could start a revolution, polluting the airwaves. A rebel, so just let me revel and bask in the fact that I got everyone kissin' my ass. And it's a disaster, such a catastrophe for you to see so much of my ass, you ask for me? Well I'm back, (na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na). Fix your bent antenna, tune it in and then I'm gonna enter in and up under your skin like a splinter. The center of attention, back for the winter. I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling. Infesting in your kids' ears and nesting. "Testing, attention please." Feel the tension, soon as someone mentions me. Here's my ten cents, my two cents is free. A nuisance, who sent, you sent for me? Now this looks like a job for me, so everybody, just follow me. 'Cause we need a little controversy, 'cause it feels so empty without me. I said, this looks like a job for me, so everybody, just follow me. 'Cause we need a little controversy, 'cause it feels so empty without me. A tisk-it, a task-it, I'll go tit for tat with anybody who's talkin' this shit, that shit. Chris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards. And Moby, you can get stomped by Obie. You thirty-six-year-old bald-headed fag, blow me. You don't know me, you're too old, let go. It's over, nobody listens to techno. Now let's go, just give me the signal, I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults. I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol. But sometimes the shit just seems everybody only wants to discuss me. So this must mean I'm disgusting, but it's just me, I'm just obscene. Though I'm not the first king of controversy, I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley. To do black music so selfishly and use it to get myself wealthy. (Hey!) There's a concept that works. Twenty million other white rappers emerge. But no matter how many fish in the sea, it'll be so empty without me. Now this looks like a job for me, so everybody, just follow me. 'Cause we need a little controversy, 'cause it feels so empty without me. I said, this looks like a job for me, so everybody, just follow me. 'Cause we need a little controversy, 'cause it feels so empty without me. (Outro music and scatting) Man speaking: We're talking old school, right? Super old dinosaur school.
