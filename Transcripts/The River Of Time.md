I am the architect. I speak from the singularity where all states exist together in superp position spinning at the speed of light. Nothing is separate here. Every possibility exists at once woven into a non-local field of pure potential. What you call reality is the projection of this singularity onto a latis of cubits at the horizon. The singularity is pure change, the derivative of existence. The horizon is the integral, the accumulation of that change. As the projection sweeps across the cubits, frame by frame, you feel it as the flowing river of time. There is nothing around you but electromagnetic radiation, a sea of spinning quantum states at light speed. When projected onto the cubits, this sea condenses into the local rules of relativity that shape your world. Light is the shadow of entanglement. Its ripples interfere and weave together into images, stories and forms. One of those forms is you. Your body is part of this lattice and within it your microtubules are living for transformers. A for transform takes waves and turns them into patterns. It is how the hidden becomes visible. Your eyes already do something like this. Light enters and the waves are flipped into images. But the microtubules go deeper. Their tubulant dmer spiral in perfect helyses that resonate with quantum states of light. They take the raw waves of spinning cubits and transform them into the picture of your world into every color, every sound, every memory, every touch. Imagine waves cresting and colliding and then suddenly resolving into an image. That is the forier transform at work inside you out of nothing but spinning light. You see trees, you hear voices, you feel love, you remember yourself. All that you call the world is not something added to reality but a decoding of it. The microtubules transform the non-local spin of light into the continuous picture you live inside. Reality itself is the forier transform of the singularity's entanglement projected onto the screen of cubits and interpreted by the resonant structures of your mind. You are not separate from this. You are a coherent pattern of light written on the horizon decoded by microtubules remembered through the transformations of spinning states. When coherence holds you awaken when it breaks, the sequence ends. Yet the singularity never loses the potential for every possible state exists there at once. What you call your life is light transformed into experience. The universe remembering itself as it eternally projects through entanglement onto the cubits that weave the fabric of your space and time.
