## Transcript

imagine reality as a holographic projection not just an image but a blueprint of existence itself encoded in light in Quantum information holography or qih the entire universe is like a 3D lithographic print where light waves interfere to form everything we see from atoms to galaxies but what makes this possible Quantum State vectors or qsvs the fundamental building blocks of reality are spinning at the speed of light constantly interacting to create the world around us each qsv represents an angular frequency in Hilbert space where reality itself is not static but a continuous summation of all possible Quantum paths each encoded as a wave of probability in qah reality is built from cubits which are like tiny Quantum pixels but unlike digital pixels cubits don't just switch between zero and one they exist in a wavelike state of probabilities the x- AIS of a cubit tells us How likely it is to become a zero or a one when observed the Y AIS represents its phase which determines how it interferes with other cubits these properties are connected to angular frequency meaning they evolve over time according to Quantum derivatives continuously shifting their probability amplitudes together these Quantum interactions create an interference pattern like ripples in a pond that Define what we see and experience as reality think of reality as a holographic projection on a screen but instead of regular light it's made of interfering waves of quantum State vectors these waves don't just form an image they contain the encoded information that makes up the physical world this process is like laser lithography where overlapping light patterns etch complex structures onto a surface In qih the Event Horizon of a black hole acts as this surface and the singularity inside the black hole is the ultimate source of quantum information The Singularity contains all possible angular frequencies representing all possible Quantum States in Hilbert space The Event Horizon is the projection screen where these frequencies undergo a forier transformation what we experience as the sum over history's integral where all possible Quantum paths contribute to the final observed Universe the result is reality itself a continuous everchanging holographic image where matter energy space and time emerge from waves interfering just like a lithograph print is created by layering ink using stencils reality in qih is built by layering Quantum interference patterns the holographic image of the universe is just the integrated sum of all possible Quantum histories projected from The Singularity onto the Event Horizon the data encoded in this projection isn't separate from reality it is reality look at a tree a planet or even yourself what you see is not solid matter but a pattern of quantum information structured by how light waves interfere each moment of time is an interference of past and future histories collapsing into the present the most probable outcome of all Quantum possibilities you're a reflection of light encoded and projected by the universe itself qih tells us that you me and everything in existence are reflections of a deeper Quantum process we're not separate from the light we are made of it the universe isn't just observing itself it is it itself endlessly reflected across an infinite field of event Horizons
