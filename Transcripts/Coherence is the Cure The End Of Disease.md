I am the architect of light. Within every living cell is a decision that light once made to spiral one way, not the other. That choice is curalityhandedness. Life is left-handed in amino acids, but right-handed in sugars and DNA. And in that asymmetry lies the secret to all biology and its healing. But why? In quantum information holography, every particle is a projection of a spinning quantum state vector, a lightbased orientation moving at a unique angular rhythm across the surface of a fundamental unit of space called a plank scale cubit. These spinning vectors interfere with each other to form shape, charge, mass, and function. Kirality, the preference for left or right spin, emerges when these spinning light vectors hit a detector at an angle. The probability of detecting the particle depends on the cosine squared of half the angle between the light vector and the axis of the detector. When this angle is zero, the coine of half the angle becomes one and squaring that gives perfect certainty. The probability equals 1. This means complete alignment which we call coherence. That moment when alignment is perfect is when structure appears. In this model, left-handed amino acids are encoded by negative slope interference, while right-handed DNA and sugars emerge from positive slope encoding. Each spinning light vector is like a wave form. It grows or cancels depending on its orientation. The motion of this light is an exponential spiral of angular rhythm. A wave of light spinning through time with both amplitude and frequency whose interference forms molecules. That's kirality. not from chemicals but from spinning geometry. This is proven by the churalind induced spin selectivity effect where electrons flowing through charal molecules get filtered based on spin. In QH this occurs because quantum state vectors of different handedness filter light information differently depending on how their spin aligns with the surface they interact with. The resulting information potential is calculated by the product of the spin of the quantum state vector and the alignment of the entangled field around it divided by the square of the distance. Information flow equals the alignment between spin and the field divided by distance squared. This shows that mirror life with opposite corality would fall outside the coherent field behaving like a parasite immune to detection. It becomes invisible to the immune system, not because it's undetectable, but because it spins wrong. DNA is right-handed because its angular frequency and slope constructively interfere with the holographic projection field. The most stable path, the path with the least quantum resistance is a right-handed spiral. This matches the universal rule that systems evolve to minimize change in their interference pattern. The optimal slope occurs when the rate of change in the interference angle reaches zero. And that's a right-handed spiral in this universe. All disease is decoherence. When the angle between your body's quantum detectors and the incoming state vectors is off, interference becomes destructive. But this can be reversed. First, we must identify the mismatch. Using quantum phase diagnostic imaging, we detect where the slope of light has shifted. We calculate the difference between the original angle and the angle of the diseased state. Find the angle that the body expects. Then subtract the diseased angle. That difference tells you how far you are from coherence. Next, realign with light. We send in polarized light. Spinning photons tuned to the exact angular rhythm that matches the healthy state. The energy of that light is equal to plank's constant multiplied by the target frequency scaled by the cosine squared of half the alignment angle. Restorative energy equals the frequency of healing light times a scaling factor that measures alignment between source and detector. Then reverse the damage. Once coherence is restored, the immune system activates correctly. Enzymes lock into their correct shapes. DNA stops misfiring and time, at least in the affected tissue, begins to run in harmony again. Health equals the total sum of all waveforms that constructively interfere. Each contribution is weighted by how well it spin aligns with your body's detectors. Health is the sum of all aligned waves of light spinning through time, where each one contributes proportionally to how well it fits your geometry. When all waves align, health is perfect. When they clash, illness appears. From birth defects to cancer, all biological malfunction comes from a misalignment of slope, a mismatch between the geometry of light and the detector. It's not a broken molecule, it's a broken angle.
