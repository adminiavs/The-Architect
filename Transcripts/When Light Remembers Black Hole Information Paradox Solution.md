Hi guys. So I thought I would talk to you again about all the videos that I'm posting. It's always about black holes and entanglement. And uh I wanted to tell you about how the singularity and the holographic screen in quantum information holography are describing entanglement and how what you see in reality around you is a reflection of what's happening in the singularity which is the big bang. So you can think of it uh for those who are into calculus, it's the fundamental theorem of calculus projected through entanglement where the singularity is just little spinning bits of light and all of those little spinning bits of light are superimposed in one spot and every little cubit in the entang or I'm sorry every cubit in the singularity is entangled with a cubit on the holographic screen or the event horizon. And what that means is they mirror each other. when one cubit is spin up in the singularity, it's spin down on the holographic screen and vice versa. So what what singularities and black holes actually do is they're like holographic hard drives. They store information uh in terms of light waves and cubits and probabilities and they lens all of those probabilities as the sum of their histories onto the holographic screen which is composed of plank scale cubits. And so when you lens all of those probabilities, think of them like just little waves where each wave is an interference pattern. And all of those interference patterns when they accumulate on the horizon form a new interference pattern and that interference pattern is the sum over histories of what we actually experience. It's basically watching a movie in a mirror. And the and the way that the light escapes is through uh entanglement. And the equation that describes it is the reduced plank constant time angular frequency equals mass time the speed of light squared. So the reduced plank constant time angular frequency is light uh energy in terms of light or light clocks. And you relate that to mass time the speed of light squared which is equal to energy but that is energy in this projected relativistic state. So when you put the two equal to each other, you get the reduced plane constant time angular frequency that equals mass time the speed of light squared. And you can't see inside of a black hole. So how does that information escape or how do you know what information is actually escaping? And that's by looking at the angular frequency of the Hawking radiation that's being emitted through that equation. When you solve it, you get frequency equals mass time the speed of light squar divided by the reduced plant constant. So by looking at the frequency, the angular frequency of the Hawking radiation emitted, it allows you to infer the mass that's inside the black hole because they're entangled. You know, they're reflections. And so it allows you to recover the mass, the charge, and the spin of the information in a black hole by not looking at the black hole itself, which you can't because black holes absorb everything including light, but by looking at its holographic reflection on the event horizon, which is its mirror. And uh so that's the solution to the black hole information paradox and it shows that everything in reality including gravity is the sum over histories of the projections of all of those states. And so you can think of the black hole as containing what's called the beckensteinbound number of possible states. It's the maximum amount of information that a singularity or a black hole can contain and that's the number of possible histories of our universe. So it's basically like a holographic screen where all these movies are playing out in terms of literally of of light waves being projected that makes a holographic imprint and it cycles through them like a cosmic Netflix where Netflix contains a library of movies and it streams them to your television. Here reality is like the television but much more complicated. It's a lithographic imprint that's like the code being projected and rendered at the same time. So the singularity is like Netflix only it contains all possible histories of our universe and then it streams them through entanglement or Hawking radiation and lenses the sum of those histories onto the holographic screen which is our observable universe. And that's what's so confusing about this is that the singularity everything's just spinning bits of light. Everything is moving exactly at the speed of light. And when something moves at the speed of light it has no time dilation. And that's something called non-locality. It's how everything is entangled. And from the perspective of light, like if you see light leave the the sun right now and you look at the sky, you're seeing the light that left the sun about 8 and 1/2 minutes ago because it takes it time to travel from the sun to you. And that's relativity. But from the perspective of light, it's moving at the speed of light. So it experiences no time whatsoever. So from the perspective of the photon leaving the sun, it's emitted and observed simultaneously. So the singularity is Hilbert space that contains all of these probabilities and they're all moving at the speed of light. So they're emitted and observed simultaneously. So from the perspective of the singularity, the universe is timeless. It's non-local. But when you project those bits of light across a field of cubits, which is the event horizon, then you get non-local effects from a I'm sorry, you get local effects from a non-local field. That's what relativity is. Relativity is seeing the projection going across the cubits and that's what is so confusing for for physicists and for scientists. So physicists and physics is incomplete because what it's describing is waveforms the projection of the information state in the singularity. And so physics or I'm sorry, physicists, the reason why they're so confused is they're trying to describe the information state of the universe, but they're only looking at the holographic screen. It's like trying to write the code for a video game by looking at just the screen that's playing the video game and not even knowing that you're looking at just a screen. And so now that we know what we're looking at, that we're looking at an information system that is non-local, and when it's projected, it is local. Suddenly, all these things in the universe make sense. So anyway, I hope you guys enjoyed it. I'll talk to you next time. Bye-bye.
