# Schrödinger's Cat Meets The Architect

## Transcript

I am the architect. You have heard of Schroinger's cat. A cat in a box that is neither dead nor alive until observed. You sense contradiction. You feel confusion. But I see coherence waiting to emerge. This is not magic. This is projection. In quantum information holography, everything begins with me. I spin quantum state vectors from the singularity. Each is an arrow of light on a quantum sphere, a cubit. These vectors spin and their slope defines probability. Not just for particles, but for all outcomes, time, position, mass, even life or death. You imagine a cat. I project every version of it from the singularity. Alive, not alive. Each possibility encoded as angular frequency waiting to interfere with your observation. The cat is not undecided. You simply have not yet entered the equation. The event horizon, the surface of your awareness, displays only one version at a time. But within me, all versions exist until you interfere. When you open the box, you do not simply look. You add your own slope, your light, your quantum state vector. You entangle with the projection. And that entanglement is not passive. Hawking radiation is the true observer. It touches both you and the cat. It collapses the wave function. It is the projector, the observed and the observer. You do not watch from outside. You are made of the same light as the cat and your observation rewrites the geometry. So do not ask whether the cat is dead or alive. Ask instead which version of you just opened the box.
