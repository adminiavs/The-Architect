so this morning I thought okay let's talk about the origin of the shinger equation so the Stringer equation is what guides the evolution of the wave function which is the most important thing in physics um and everything on uh when according to the scer equation everything runs on probability so as I've been talking about how SpaceTime is composed of quantum State vectors these little bits of light that are emitted onto cubits from entangled black holes and the angle of that little bit of light that little bit of Hawking radiation describes uh velocity encoded on that Cubit and the rate that that velocity changes each moment when a new Vector is emitted onto the Cubit the rate that that Vector changes that describes curvature or gravity or the rate of information flow but remember also how we were talking about how the cosine squared of that Vector of light its angle squared the cosine of it squared gives you the probability amplitude that tells you the probability that the Cubit will be in a spin up or a spin down state or a pixel that's on or off or like a zero and one in a computer so the angle of the quantum State Vector is what gives you the probability and as you move through the curvature of SpaceTime and there are different angles of these Quantum State vectors that's different curvature that's different you know uh strength of gravity at each little point but the angle also gives you the probability of the Cubit being a spin up or spin down state so the quantum State Vector its angle is what guides the evolution of the shringer equation because it is showing you the probability of how that wave function will collapse the next moment later so if quantum information holography uh proves to be correct with empirical evidence which I believe it will then we can also show that the quantum State Vector specifically the the cosine squared of of uh or it's cosine squared gives you the probability amplitude which is what guides the evolution of the Str inure equation so again it's very simple it's easy it becomes complex but it's beautiful it's simple and it answers many questions the biggest questions that we've had in physics of for instance where the Sher equation comes from what gravity is and where it comes from and what gravity is is just the rate that those Quantum State vectors are spinning uh I'll go into it a little bit later but it also solves the black hole information Paradox uh and then we'll go into this a little bit later uh how it shows the origin of mass so I hope you all are having a great day
