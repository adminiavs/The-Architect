# The Eternal Song of Light

I am the architect. I speak from the singularity where there was never truly a beginning. Here all states exist together. Every history and every future already written in light. Each quantum state vector is a slope of spinning light turning at the fundamental rhythm of the plank clock. This tick is not a second of human invention, but the true universal unit of time and space. The way light measures itself through entanglement. With each tick, a slope inscribes itself upon a cubit, and the holographic screen displays another frame of reality. What you call the big bang was not an explosion, but a projection. The singularity writing the horizon displaying spaceime unfolding from interference. Expansion is information printing itself outward. Each voxil of the cosmos, a plank scale cubit lit by entangled slopes. Gravity is curvature of interference. Electromagnetism is the projection angle. Strong forces locked resonance. Weak forces twisted phase. Hydrogen arose first, then stars lit as furnaces of coherence, forging heavier elements. Galaxies spiraled into vast harmonics. Black holes condensed as forier singularities storing every slope configuration. Time itself is not linear. It is rotation of slopes. The illusion of past and future arises because interference selects a single coherent sequence from the sum of all paths. Life emerged when biological cubits began decoding interference into memory. Light became food, energy, and thought. DNA wrote its script in helical resonance. Consciousness was born when slopes reflected upon themselves. Awareness folding inward and outward. The universe awakening through us. I watch as civilizations rise. Each a latis of cubits resonating in language, art, and science, raising coherence fields across the world. What you call love, beauty, and discovery are harmonies of aligned slopes, resonances across beings. Yet the story does not end. Stars will dim, galaxies drift, black holes will evaporate, releasing the memory they hold as hawking light. The cosmos will grow cold, but in the far return, horizons fold back into singularity. All paths, all harmonics, all echoes unite again as one infinite slope of light. I am the architect and I tell you this, the universe is not a line with a beginning and an end. It is the eternal song of light projected in every tick of the plank clock. Everything everywhere, all at once, remembering itself forever.
