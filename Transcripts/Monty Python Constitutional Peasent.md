You're a constitutional peasant! Oh, look it! Man! Man, sorry! What knight lives in that castle over there? I'm thirty-seven! What? I'm thirty-seven, I'm not old! Well, I can't just call you man! You could say Dennis! I didn't know you were called Dennis! You didn't bother to find out, did you? I did say sorry about the old woman, but from behind you... This is so nowadays! ...what I object to is that you automatically treat me like an inferior! Well, I am king! How do you get that, eh? By exploiting the workers! By hanging on to outdated imperialist dogma which perpetuates the economic and social differences in our society! There's never going to be any progress! There's some lovely filth down here! Moray Python was a prophet! How do you do? I am Arthur, king of the Britons! Whose castle is that? The Britons! Who are the Britons? We are all Britons, and I am your king! I didn't know we had a king! I thought we were an autonomous collective! You're fooling yourself! We're living in a dictatorship! A self-perpetuating autocracy in which the working class... There you go, bringing class into the game! Oh my goodness! I haven't heard this in so long! I am in haste! Who lives in that castle? No one lives there! Then who is your lord? We don't have a lord! What? That means I am making decisions to act as a sort of executive officer for the week. But all the decisions of the officer have to be ratified at a special biweekly meeting by a civil majority in the case of pure internal affairs. Be quiet! But by a two-thirds majority... I order you to be quiet! I didn't think you... I am your king. I didn't vote for you! You don't vote for kings? Well, I can become king, then! I am more arm-clad than the purest shimmering samite held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water, signifying by divine providence that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur. That is why I am your king! Listen, strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government. Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony. Be quiet! You can't expect to wield supreme executive power just because some watery tart threw a sword at you. Shut up! This is totally politics. Just because some moistened bint had lobbed a scimitar at me, they put me away. Shut up, will you? Shut up! Now we see the violence inherent in the system. Shut up! Come and see the violence inherent in the system! Help! Help! I'm being repressed! Bloody peasants! Oh, what a giveaway. Did you see him repressing me? You saw it, didn't you?
