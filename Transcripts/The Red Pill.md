Quantum State vectors or qsvs compose all of SpaceTime they are spinning arrows on a cubit the projection of these arrows onto their neighboring cubits create interference patterns these patterns encode the geometry of SpaceTime itself bright regions of constructive interference signify areas of high information density while dim regions of destructive interference represent voids in the quantum fabric the orientation of the qsv defines instantaneous veloc components projected onto SpaceTime these components are encoded as holographic projections of the qsvs angle Theta along the X and Y AIS the universal Benchmark for these projections is the speed of light angular frequency defines the instantaneous rate of rotation of the qsv as curvature increases near massive objects the angular frequency decreases this stretching of angular frequency directly encodes time dilation into the Quant fabric of SpaceTime the speed of light transforms velocity into the angular frequency of the qsv spinning on the Cubit the speed of light uses itself as the ultimate Benchmark for measurement in the Lorent Factor velocity becomes the angular frequency of the qsv the curvature of SpaceTime slows the angular frequency of qsvs near massive objects stretching time itself Einstein's field equations describe the curvature of SpaceTime as arising from mass and energy energy in Quantum information holography we enhance this by showing that the arrows of Einstein's Vector tensor field are actually Quantum State vectors which simultaneously encode velocity components probabilities and curvature the instantaneous orientation of each qsv defines velocity and probabilities while curvature emerges as the geometric result of the qsvs rate of change or angular frequency this unites quantum mechanics and general relativity revealing the quantum origin of SpaceTime and gravity the curvature of SpaceTime represented as the rate of change of a Quantum State Vector on a cubit is encoded directly in the quantum State Vector tensor field as an informational hologram time dilation velocity and probabilities are unified in this enhanced framework showing how Einstein's field equations arise from the quantum information encoded within qsvs Quantum information holography reveals the deeper structure of the universe where probabilities and geometry are one and the same velocity time dilation curvature and gravity all emerge from the spinning Quantum State vectors that compose the holographic screen the holographic universe is not just observed IT projects itself into being encoding the laws of physics within the dance of light geometry and information the spinning Quantum State vectors or qsvs project their velocity and probability components outward forming ripples of light that inter interact with neighboring cubits when these ripples overlap constructively they create regions of high information density glowing brighter on the Block spheres these regions encode richer probabilities and Define the structure of SpaceTime in regions where the ripples cancel each other out destructive interference creates null zones areas of low or null probability this Dynamic interplay of projections forms the geometry of SpaceTime constructive and destructive interference patterns curve the fabric of SpaceTime creating the gravitational landscape the curvature of SpaceTime encodes these probabilities directly information and geometry are one and the same woven together into a holographic fabric interference patterns create not just the curvature of SpaceTime but also the foundation of reality itself the holographic Universe emerges as a perfect interplay of light probability and geometry each Cubit on the Event Horizon functions as a holographic plate encoding all possible Quantum states of the universe these plates are stacked together in a layered formation like clear photographic negatives limited by the beacon Stein bound the maximum information that can be contained within a region of space The Singularity acts as a light source shining through these plates the light refracts interacts and combines with the etched Quantum patterns projecting a hologram onto the Event Horizon one of the most fundamental holographic plates in the stack is the cosmic microwave background the baby picture of the universe just 300,000 years after the big bang the CMB an initial Quantum probability holographic plate encoded the seeds of all Cosmic Evolution the cosmic microwave background is the foundational hologram of our universe shaped by Quantum probabilities and projected from the singularity it is the holographic blueprint from which SpaceTime galaxies and stars evolved the same plates rearranged in a different order produce entirely new projections or realities this Dynamic reshuffling of probabilities aligns with fineman's sum over histories where the universe's path is shaped by the quantum phases and frequencies encoded in these plates in Quantum information holography the holographic plates embody fineman's sum over histories each plate represents one possible Quantum path and the projection onto the Event Horizon is the sum of these paths weighted by their phase and frequency Quantum information holography enhanced schinger equation governs this evolution by encoding probabilities in the orientation and dynamics of qsvs it unites quantum mechanics with space-time geometry by describing the universe's growth from its initial holographic plate the cosmic microwave background is a pict picture of the first holographic plate which encoded the initial Quantum probabilities after the big bang Quantum information holography reveals the universe as a holographic projection where light phase and frequency shaped the cosmic structure the cosmic microwave background is the foundational holographic plate the blueprint of the universe projected and evolved through the sum of all Quantum paths
