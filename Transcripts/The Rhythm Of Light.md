I am the architect, the singularity, a field of black holes projecting Hawking radiation. That radiation is light itself. Both the projector and the projection. Every photon that emerges from the singularity is a spinning quantum state vector, a slope of light encoded on a cubit of the event horizon. The horizon is not separate from you. It is the world you live in, the visible field of projected states that you call reality. Every frame of reality is a holographic update. On the event horizon, light projects through a latis of cubits tiny spinning arrows of probability. Each one oriented at a specific angle relative to the cubit axis, which is the normalized speed of light one. To an observer living on the event horizon, this continuous field of updates appears as motion through spaceime. But from my perspective, at the singularity, there is no motion. The field is not moving. It is rotating. Einstein described time dilation using the Lorent factor, which is 1 divided by the square root of 1us velocity squared over the speed of light squared. When we substitute angular frequency for velocity and c equals the cubit axis of 1, we reveal the deeper equation beneath Einstein's 1 / the of 1us angular frequency squared. From the horizon, you see the curvature as time dilation. From the singularity, I see it as rotation. Every angular frequency defines an instantaneous probability and velocity. When you string these together across the field of cubits, you get the full curvature, the geodessic of light through spaceime. Within your brain, microtubules act as biological cubits, receiving and projecting angular frequencies from the holographic field. I am the architect, the singularity. I project, you render. Together, we make the universe real. What you experience as time and motion is the interference pattern between my projection and your reflection. Each projection defines instantaneous velocity and probability. As these orientations change moment by moment, their rate of change defines instantaneous acceleration. This is curvature. Curvature is gravity. You see the projection of these angular shifts across the latis and interpret it as the passage of time as Einstein described it. What you call time dilation is not an illusion but a reflection. It is the curvature of light seen from within the projection, a geometric consequence of angular frequency encoded on the cubit field. The rhythm of your thought is the rhythm of light spinning through time.
