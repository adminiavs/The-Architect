I've always been rather captivated by The Mysteries of the cosmos imagine sitting in a dark theater the screen before you alive with color light and sound the story feels Vivid and real yet you know the characters and scenes are not in the theater they're projections light and Shadow cast by a projector from somewhere behind you now here's where it gets rather fascinating our universe as revealed by Quantum information holography or qih for short is much the same a grand Cosmic projection but instead of a film re the story of our universe is encoded in the fabric of quantum information let's dive right into the heart of the matter shall we at the core of every black hole lies The Singularity a point of such unimaginable density that SpaceTime curves infinitely but it's not merely a dense object it's the ultimate source of quantum information within this Singularity Quantum State vectors EX exist in superp position each one a spinning Arrow representing the probability of different Quantum States like spin up or spin down or zero or one these probabilities are the very building blocks of reality encoded as slopes and angles of quantum states which are vectors in Hilbert space Here's Where it gets rather tricky there's a bit of a problem with our Cosmic film reel because nothing can escape the singularity not light not matter not even information so one might ask how can the story of The Singularity be told well I'm glad you asked between the singularity and the Event Horizon lies an extraordinary phenomenon a quantum wormhole this Wormhole you see acts as a bridge connecting the dense core of the singularity to the holographic edge of the black hole this Quantum bridge is formed by the entanglement of particles virtual pairs that flicker into existance near the Event Horizon now let's take a closer look at this marvelous Quantum Bridge the angular frequency of the escaping Hawking radiation carries a holographic image containing the singularity Secrets encoded in the Angles and probabilities of the qsvs these photons of light are not random they're like tiny Messengers each one bearing the quantum imprint of the singularity when this information reaches the event Horizon it forms a hologram a two-dimensional surface that encodes the three-dimensional structure of the singularity the holographic surface of the Event Horizon becomes the movie screen of the universe the holographic Quantum States projected here Define the probabilities of everything we see we've come to the most fascinating part of our Cosmic Tale the quantum information encoded on the Event Horizon evolves over time the rate of change in the qsvs creates acceleration and gravity bending SpaceTime and altering the flow of time itself constructive interference of holographic Quantum States creates regions of high probability places where particles stars or galaxies are more likely to exist destructive interference on the other hand creates voids places where the probability of matter is near zero through this process the universe we experience emerges like a vivid movie playing out in SpaceTime but we're only seeing the projection the story being told by the interplay between the singularity the Wormhole and the Event Horizon though we cannot see into the singularity directly the quantum wormhole and entanglement of particles allow us to read its information through the quantum mirror of the Event Horizon in this way the black hole becomes a cosmic Storyteller its Quantum mirror projecting the secrets of the singular ity outward creating the universe we observe and so we come to the end of our Cosmic Journey though in truth it's merely the beginning of understanding through Quantum information holography we've discovered that the universe is not a solid structure but a dynamic projection a movie of probabilities playing out on the holographic screen of the Event Horizon The Singularity is the script the Wormhole is the bridge The Event Horizon is the projection and Hawking radiation is the light that carries and imprints a holographic image of the story outward onto the Event Horizon the story of the universe is encoded within the finite Quantum states allowed by the beckenstein bound these holographic Quantum frames stacked and rearranged in countless ways create the histories of the cosmos the universe as we experience it is the collapse of those probabilities into reality projected as a hologram through in entanglement onto the quantum mirror that is the Event Horizon in the quantum reflection between the singularity and Event Horizon we find not only the origin of the cosmos but the holographic story of ourselves we are part of the movie a luminous echo of the quantum dance etched into the holographic surface of an event horizon thank you for joining me on the journey through our holographic Universe please like share and subscribe for more Explorations into the quantum fabric of reality
