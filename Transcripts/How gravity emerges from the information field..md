so I was thinking I uh today I could talk a little bit about how uh SpaceTime is composed of quantum State Vector these little vectors of light that I was describing in my last video and how the vector is light the rate of change of the quantum State Vector is describing curvature or gravity and also the rate that information flows cuz there is information contained within the angle of the vector and the rate that the vector changes is the rate that information is changing so the reason why that's important is because there's something called lorensen variance when when you start approaching uh close to the speed of light or or very high velocities you start getting time dilation length contractions and and it causes problems um but since these Quantum State vectors that are emitted from entangled black holes onto a cubit are like zeros and ones the the uh cosine squared of the angle of each Quantum State Vector gives you the probability amplitude in other words it tells you the probability that the Cubit will be in a spin up or a spin down state or zero or N1 like in a computer or a pixel that is on or a pixel that is off and we see the behavior and we see relativistic behaviors you know uh from light and things moving at at at at very high velocity and that causes an issue with Loren and variance but what Quantum information holography says and shows and demonstrates is that underneath that the informational content is just zeros and ones and since it's the information is just zeros and ones it doesn't change it's naturally Loren invariant regardless of the observer's frame of reference and so light itself when viewed as information on cubits is naturally Floren invariant and there is no Theory besides this that is naturally invariant and and it's naturally invariant using the most fundamental thing and that is light and so that that is why it's important to look at this in terms of information because as we were talking about before the angle of the quantum State Vector that encodes the uh velocity on of that Cubit as a percentage of the speed of light but that's just one snapshot one moment later the quantum State Vector is emitted again and if it changes that gives you an acceleration and even if it doesn't change that means no change in acceleration that means acceleration is zero and that's when you're out in space where there's no gravity and but what's important about that is that when you look at just one snapshot of the universe just one picture frame that gives you all the quantum State vectors and that gives you the velocity but you cannot calculate acceleration without having a change in veloc velocity so you need two picture frames two bits of information compared to each other one snapshot of a Quantum State vector and another snapshot to give you a rate of change and that is what gives you gravity and curvature so what it means is that gravity emerges from the information field because the information field one snapshot it is an information field but it doesn't describe gravity gravity comes and emerges from the rate of change of the information field so information is what's fundamental and gravity emerges from it it's pretty darn cool
