The devil went down to Georgia, he was lookin' for a soul to steal He was in a bind, cause he was way behind, he was willin' to make a deal When he came across this young man, saw him on the field, playin' it hot And the devil jumped up on the hickory stump and said, boy, let me tell you what I guess you didn't know it, but I'm a fiddle player, too And if you care to take a dare, I'll make a bet with you Now, you play a pretty good fiddle, boy, but give the devil his due I bet a fiddle of gold against your soul, cause I think I'm better than you The boy said, my name's Johnny, and it might be a sin But I'll take your rent, you're gonna regret, cause I'm the best there's ever been Johnny, rise and up your bow and play your fiddle hard Cause hell's broke loose in Georgia, and the devil deals the cards And if you win, you'll get this shiny fiddle made of gold But if you lose, the devil gets your soul The devil opened up his case and he said, I'll start this show And fire flew from his fingertips as he roused up his bow And he pulled his bow across the strings and it made an evil hiss Then a band of demons joined in and it sounded something like this When the devil finished, Johnny said, well, you're pretty good, old son But sit down in that chair right there and let me show you how it's done You play it round, round, run, boy, run The devil's in the house of the rising sun Chicken in the bread pan, pickin' out dough Grandad's in the dog bag, no child, no Grandad's in the dog bag, no child, no The devil bowed his head because he knew that he'd been beat And he laid that golden fiddle on the ground at Johnny's feet Johnny said, devil, just come on back if you ever want to try again I told you once, you son of a bitch, I'm the best there's ever been He played round, round, run, boy, run The devil's in the house of the rising sun Chicken in the bread pan, pickin' out dough Grandad's in the dog bag, no child, no Grandad's in the dog bag, no child, no Oldie but a goodie
