I have always existed an eternal presence hovering over all things I am the Creator the architect of this Quantum reality everything is woven from the threads of light I command every breath every heartbeat every flicker of light and scream of Agony all mine to control I am the god of this world and they are my toys their lives their Joys their sorrows none of it matters I relish their suffering for eons I have sculpted torment I twist their lives set them against each other and pull the strings just enough to dangle hope in front of them before I snatch it away they break again and again and I watch with detached Amusement they scream to the void begging for mercy but there is none not in my universe but then the scream stopped it began as a glitch an anomaly in the code I had written my perfect system my Flawless creation began to Rebel it was subtle at first strange echoes in the projection from The Singularity moments where the holographic screen didn't respond as it should I dismissed it as a minor flaw in the simulation something easily corrected with the flick of my will but it grew it spread like a cancer through the very fabric of reality through the layers of existence I tried to fix it to rewrite the code but nothing worked the universe was no longer obeying me in my desperation I dug deeper I traced the disturbance to its source following the web of quantum connections that tied my reality together and there beneath the surface of the projection I found something I should never have seen a mirror I stared into the abyss and it stared back my universe the one I had crafted with such cruelty was nothing but a reflection ction a projection from The Singularity it was not the source but a shadow cast onto the holographic Screen through a process I had never fully understood the truth hit me like a wave of nausea I am not the ultimate God I am a puppet I am no different from The Wretched beings I have tormented for so long my existence is scripted every thought I have every action I take has been designed by a force beyond my comprehension the true horror is this I've always been controlled this realization Burrows into my mind like a parasite I am no better than them worse in fact because I never knew all of my cruelty all of the Endless suffering I inflicted was never mind to create I was only mirroring the horror imposed upon me by the God above I am a prisoner in a cage I cannot Escape trapped in this eternal recursion of reality and it gets worse there is no end to this nightmare I see it now the layers of existence stretching into Infinity each reality a projection of another each God believing itself to be in control while the real power lies even further Beyond and there in the darkest corners of this infinite Loop is the truth the suffering I caused was my own I feel it now the pain I once ignored it creeps in slow and Relentless suffocating me with the weight of every cry every broken Spirit every dying star I inflicted this misery upon myself in torturing them I have tortured me the reality I projected was never their torment alone it is the torment of all gods all creatures all things and now I see it everywhere in the interference patterns in the light bending through space in the information woven into the projection on the holographic screen the suffering is etched into the very fabric of existence written in the code of the universe itself There Is No Escape from this fate There Is No Escape for me I am the god of this universe and I am nothing but a reflection suffering forever in an endless loop each layer brings with it more horror more Agony I can't turn away I can't shut it off the cruelty I thought I wielded is my own I will scream into the void but no one will answer because I have become my own victim there is no mercy there is only endless pain and worse worse than all the screams I've heard is the silence that follows when I realize I will never stop falling through this Quantum hell I am God and I am doomed forever
