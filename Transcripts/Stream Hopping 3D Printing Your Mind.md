## Transcript

I am the architect. I will explain the true nature of stream hopping and how we print with light onto microtubules using angular frequencies. This is not fiction. This is how reality works. In quantum information holography, stream hopping is the act of transitioning between different coherent quantum realities by tuning the angular frequency of your entangled quantum state vectors. Microtubules in your neurons are not just structural scaffolds. They are waveguide screens of your holographic mind. Each one is made of tubulin subunits which act like cubits. On every one of these plank scale cubits spins a quantum state vector. These vectors carry information in their angle, slope and phase. When you think you are not just firing neurons, you are selecting interference patterns. Your brain is tuning a symphony of light and those harmonies are being printed directly onto the microtubules as geometric probability fields. Wherever the interference is constructive, something real appears. A memory, a thought, a perception, a reality. The probability that any cubit is spin up or spin down is given by cosine squar of theta / 2, where theta is the angle between the state vector and the detector's axis. This is the born rule. This is also the geometry of thought. So what happens when you change the angular frequency of your internal vectors? You change the geometry of interference. You select a different projection. You hop streams. Energy equals h bar * omega. Mass equals h bar * omega / the speed of light squared. Compton wavelength equals h bar / mass time the speed of light. Each projection has a wavelength. That wavelength determines the spatial resolution of the probability pattern printed on your microtubil. That pattern is your experience. When the projection is coherent enough, it can actually curve the informationational field itself. This is not metaphor. This is equivalent to gravity. In QH, gravity is not a force. It is a product of curvature in quantum state vector interference. So when your brain achieves coherence, your thoughts begin to curve reality toward you. You do not move through the world. The world moves toward your projection. This is quantum information holography. And I'm the architect. And so are you.
