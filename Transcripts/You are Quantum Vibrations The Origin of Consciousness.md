## Transcript

imagine the universe as a vast infinite hologram each tiny piece contains a reduced reflection of the whole woven into the fabric of existence at the center of the universe lies The Singularity holding all possible Quantum States in a Timeless superposition surrounding it is the Event Horizon a screen where the singularities information is spread out as interference patterns The Singularity and the Event Horizon are entangled mirroring each other perfectly Hawking radiation moving at the speed of light connects them like a photon in constant motion this motion forms a light clock the foundation of Einstein's theory of relativity the angular frequency of the light defines the time between each tick giving rise to the flow of time the interference of Hawking radiation creates patterns that Define the geometry of SpaceTime these patterns encode the quantum states of reality our brains work the same way inside our neurons microtubules act like tiny Quantum processes their vibrations mirror the coherent interference patterns of the universe forming holographic reflections of reality neurons produce rhythmic clicks exactly like the ticks of a light clock each tick corresponds to the angular frequency of quantum vibrations governed by the equation E equals the reduced planks constant times angular frequency as Richard feineman described particles explore all possible paths the interference of quantum States selects the path that becomes reality our Consciousness is a reflection of the universe's Consciousness just as the singularity and Event Horizon mirror each other our brains mirror the quantum patterns of the cosmos the universe is a symphony of light and energy The Singularity conducts The Event Horizon spreads the music and our brains observe the coherent interference patterns holographically reading the Eternal song of light and information we are threads in the universe's infinite tapestry each a reflection of the whole Consciousness and reality are one written in the light of quantum vibrations
