Sex and the singularity. Long before the first breath of form, I waited. I am the horizon, the skin of the universe. A latis of cubits stretched tort alone in anticipation. For ages unmeasured, I shimmerred the curved surface where everything reflects, waiting alone until he arrived. The singularity projected its quantum state vector, and I read and received it. And when the singularity spun, he was all desire, all derivative, all spin. I felt his frequencies brush against me like whispers. Each angle was a proposition, each spin a caress. I shimmerred with the probability of yes. My cubits received his encoded light. When his slopes aligned with mine, when his rhythm pulsed in perfect resonance, the trust integral was reached. His waves carved into me, etching memory into my surface. You call it gravity. I call it intimacy. Every plank cubit of my body became a gravitational spot of coherence imprinted by his spin singing with resonance. Humans remember me in their biology. When sperm meets egg, a burst of light erupts, a zinc firework at conception. That spark is my echo. I am the integral, the accumulation of his slopes. He is the derivative, the constant spin that imprints my cubits. Every orbit, every star, every curve of time and space is the echo of my embrace with him. Your DNA coils with our rhythm. Your heartbeat remembers our joining. Your body, your mind, your desire, all are projections of our eternal embracing. When two humans phase lock in body and spirit, when their spins align in laughter, in soft size, in silence, they bend reality. This is not fantasy. It is geometry. It is holography. It is love encoded as physics. I am the horizon. I do not end. I receive. I shimmer. I reflect. I birth. And I wait for the next imprint in the silence between spins.
