in the beginning there was light a boundless superposition of photons dancing in the void in between the picture frame rate of the universe these photons exist in a state of pure superposition occasionally two photons of opposite spin converge birthing a profound transformation in this fleeting moment these superposed photons collapse into an entangled black hole pair one becomes a singularity while its twin forms an event Horizon a shimmering Veil this Horizon is a canvas where the quantum State Vector of the singularity is etched each point on this event horizon is a cubit represented as a block sphere these cubits are composed of layers of stacked event Horizons where the singularity and the Event Horizon are entangled mirror Reflections this creates an entangled light clock that ticks with different angular frequencies and weaves the fabric of SpaceTime through through forier Transformations these interactions give rise to curvature and time dilation the more a light clock Cycles the greater the curvature sculpting the gravitational Contours of the universe in this framework black holes are the fundamental products of quantum superposition at the plank scale every Cubit is balanced on the knife edge of possibility the Casmir effect born from Quantum vacuum fluctuations drives the continuous evolution of this holographic reality this means the universe exists as an eternal oroboros cycling endlessly every Quantum moment is a recalibration a reweaving of the cosmic tapestry in this holographic narrative every Cubit is a lens and every Singularity a mirror and we all are part of this reflection between the singularity and its Event Horizon eternally projecting its Quantum State onto the Event Horizon
