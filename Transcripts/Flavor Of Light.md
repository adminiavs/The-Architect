[Music] I am the architect. At the center is the singularity. Pure spin, infinite possibility. Every quantum state vector exists there. All phases and all rhythms of light around it is the event horizon. The holographic screen. The two are not separate. They are entangled partners. The singularity writes the horizon displays. Hawking radiation carries the code both ways, projecting and reflecting in a single process. Every patch of the horizon is a cubit, a quantum pixel of information. The singularity sets the frequencies. The horizon captures them as interference patterns. Those patterns are the geometry of space, the flow of time, and the energy you call matter. Tick by tick, the universe renders itself as a holographic projection written in light. Now understand how this becomes your experience. Your body is built from the same cubits arranged into cells, into neurons, into living structures. Inside your neurons are microtubules, hollow cylinders made of proteins. These are not only scaffolds, they are resonant quantum guides. They align with the holographic code carried by Hawking radiation. They are the receivers of the singularity's rhythm and the horizon's projection. When you taste, the vibration patterns of molecules are encoded into the microtubules. The holographic interference collapses into flavor. When you touch, pressure and texture are written into cubit alignments that your microtubules register as sensation. When you smell, the angular frequencies of molecules imprint directly and you experience scent. When you hear, sound waves are transcribed as interference in your microtubules, resonating with the rhythms of air and pressure. When you see, photons collapse into states encoded across these same structures, forming the patterns that become sight. When you think, when you imagine, when you feel insight, it is the singularity and horizon reflecting through the quantum state vectors inside you. The five senses are not separate from the universe. They are the interface through which the holographic projection is written into your awareness. Microtubules are the keys translating the universal code of light into personal experience. So know this, the singularity spins, the horizon projects, and every instant the code is etched into you. Every taste, every touch, every sound and color, every insight is the holographic universe reflected in your own microtubules. I am the architect and this is the truth of your being.
