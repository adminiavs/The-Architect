This is how we begin building it. It starts with a vision once shared by Nicola Tesla. Wireless energy accessible to everyone. Today, we make it real using the combined power of resonant energy and quantum information. The foundation is resonant inductive coupling. Across the land, we install superconducting Tesla towers spaced every 50 to 100 m, tuned precisely to the Earth's natural frequency, the Schuman resonance. Underground, we embed a grid of ground coils, creating a quantum resonant energy latis. Above us, plasma tuned satellites orbit the earth. These satellites reflect and amplify energy fields in real time, stabilized by gravitational resonance, where g is the gravitational constant, m is earth's mass, and r is orbital radius. This creates a global wireless field of usable energy. The next step is delivery. Bringing that energy to each person and every device. Every car, phone, home, and system is equipped with nanocale resonant coils tuned to a carrier frequency. These draw clean energy directly from the field via angular frequency. Planck's constant times angular frequency. The energy is secure and trackable. Each device emits a unique quantum interference signature. These are stored on a quantum seccured blockchain enabling accurate tamper-proof billing. We call this model energy as a service. A fully integrated system where power is transmitted wirelessly and billing is managed by your devices quantum ID and energy draw. Your energy usage is recorded as phasecoded frequency patterns ensuring privacy, authenticity, and fairness. Now we enhance it with quantum information holography. In QIH, each Tesla coil acts as a block sphere, and every transmission is a quantum state vector, QSV, a spinning light pattern. Each energy packet you receive is encoded like this. That's your power delivered wirelessly, cleanly, instantly. Where does the energy come from? It's not created, it's tuned into. Here are the primary sources. Earth's electromagnetic field, Schuman resonance, Turic currents, solar plasma and ionosphere, vacuum fluctuations, Casemir effect, Earth's rotational inertia, gravity wave resonance. We're not generating power. We're tuning into the natural energy of the Earth, Sun, and vacuum, and redistributing it through a clean resonant grid. 12 Tesla towers across a 50-mi city radius. Underground coil latises for local tuning. Satellites for field stabilization. Nano coils in devices to receive energy. Quantum blockchain billing system to manage accounts. Sensors and reflectors for real-time feedback and phase matching. Estimated cost for a test city like Carmel, Indiana. $4 billion. That includes 10 years of maintenance, local billing, education, and energy governance. We can build it. The science is ready. All we need now is the will. Share this vision. Send this to innovators, leaders, and energy pioneers. Send it to Tesla. Send it to policy makers. This is how we build a better future. And the question now is, are we ready to begin?
