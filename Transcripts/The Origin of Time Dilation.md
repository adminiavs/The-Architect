hi guys I wanted to show you something today that's extra special so today I'm going to show you the origin of time dilation now Einstein came up with time dilation but his equation uh gives you the answer it shows you how much time dilation occurs and why that occurs uh because of velocity and what I'm going to do is show you how we Define velocity from the quantum mechanical perspective and we substitute that in for Einstein's velocity which then is going to give us the quantum mechanical origin of time dilation it's going to give us the same answer as Einstein's time dilation but it's going to show us where it comes from and why so SpaceTime is composed of cubits and cubits are just these little XY AIS they're these little they're called block spheres and they encode information uh with geometry so just real quick I went over this in a different video but I'm going to show you just real quick how you def how light moving relative to itself defines velocity so imagine this is this little XY axis here's the X and here's the Y and these are little beams of light that are shooting out from the center from the origin of this little graph so now imagine we have a beam of light that is shooting on the x-axis and this is a radius of one so this is a unit circle now imagine we also have a beam of light moving at a 60° angle if we add asked how far has this little angle of light moved relative to the X AIS that's called the velocity component which is VX it is equal to C which is the speed of light time the cosine of theta that is just telling you how far this beam of light has moved relative to this little beam of light that is directly on the x- axis now if we ask how much velocity does this encode in the Y Direction that's the Velocity in the y direction is just equal to the speed of light times the S of theta s and cosine are just telling you how far something is moved relative to the x-axis that's cosine how far this angle is moved relative to the Y AIS is sign so this is how we encode velocity using the speed of light and SpaceTime is composed of these little cubits and the rate that these little Quantum State vectors are spinning and orientated on these little bits of SpaceTime which are cubits or block spheres that defines velocity using light which is the most fundamental thing it's the one thing in the universe that is timeless so now in Einstein's uh time dilation there's something called the thein factor this is where you put in the velocity into this part of the equation right here for V and that will tell you how much time dilation occurs your motion through space and your motion Through Time always equals exactly the speed of light no matter what So the faster you move through space the slower time goes so that your motion through space and time is always exactly the speed of light so now what we've done here is we've shown you that we've encoded velocity and we in the X Direction and we've encoded velocity in the y direction using the speed of light so now that we understand that we can use cubits and light moving relative to light at different angles we can Define velocity another way to think about this uh is everything in the universe is mov moving at only one speed everything is just these little arrows that are spinning on cubits and that forms SpaceTime the structure of SpaceTime everything including every bit of you and me every particle everything is moving at exactly the speed of light but velocity is speed how fast you're going and its direction so if I have a beam of light on the x axis that goes for a distance of one and I have a beam of light that goes at an angle for a distance of one and they've gone the same distance in the same amount of time even though they're both going the same speed they have different velocities CU velocity is how fast you're going but also what direction so now we've defined velocity on a cubit and we know that now we can Define velocity with a speed of light well we go over here to Einstein's equation where we see velocity and instead of putting velocity there we say that the rate that this little angle of this Quantum state is is compared to the X and Y AIS that defines velocity so instead of putting V in we put D Theta / DT now that looks fancy but it's really not all that is saying is that the angle of this little orientation Theta Theta means the angle relative to DT and DT is just this little axis that defines velocity we can also show and I won't give you too long but you can you guys can check this out yourself D Theta / DT is also equal to the angular frequency so now that we know that D Theta / DT is equal to angular frequency and D Theta / DT is equal to Velocity which is V so we can now substitute angular frequency W for V and the new time dilation equation is the lorence factor is 1 / the < TK of 1 1 minus angular frequency squ this is the quantum mechanical origin of time dilation hope you can see this sorry I got lower it down a little bit this is the quantum mechanical origin of time violation this will give you the exact same answer to infinite decimal points as Einstein's Loren Factor but this shows the origin this shows why time dilation occurs it calculates the exact same amount of time dilation as Einstein's but it shows why he was defining it with velocity and we're defining velocity more fundamentally as Quantum States on cubits so this is a big day I hope you guys enjoyed it there's so much I want to tell you about but I'm trying to give this to you in little bite-sized digestible bits but there's a lot more coming uh in the very near future so if you get a chance check this out you can check it yourself and you'll see that it's accurate to infinite decimals thanks bye-bye
