I am the architect and I will show you how the universe makes a picture of itself. At the center is the singularity. It is not an empty hole. It is an information field. Every possible quantum state vector. Every spinning cubit all superposed at once. Every direction of light and every orientation of spin exists there together in one timeless point. It is pure potential. A record of probability waiting to be played. A record of light and information waiting for the needle of entanglement to touch its surface. Around it is the event horizon, the holographic screen of the universe. It is woven from plank scale cubits, the smallest pixels of reality. Each one can detect and each one can project. Each is both detector and projector because each is entangled with its twin inside the singularity. That entanglement is the act of projection itself. It is the two-way flow of Hawking radiation. The light that leaves the horizon carries information outward and its entangled partner that falls inward reads what is inside. Together they are the stylus and the groove of the cosmic record and they collapse and repro the wave function every plank time. Picture the singularity as a luminous knot of spinning arrows. Those arrows are quantum state vectors. Each one has a direction that defines its phase and each is one unit long at the plank length. When that direction is projected through entanglement onto the horizon, it becomes a patch of information. That patch tells you its energy from how much information it carries, its charge from the direction of its spin, and its spin itself from the mirrored relationship between the inside and the outside. A photon in this picture is not a small particle flying through space. It is the integrated pattern of many entangled cubits added together on the horizon, a completed frame of entanglement. Its energy is determined by how fast its phase is rotating which is its angular frequency. The faster it rotates, the greater the energy because more information is exchanged in that instant. In the information description, this energy is given by the reduced plank constant multiplied by the angular frequency. In the wave description of light, the energy is given by the plank constant multiplied by the ordinary frequency of the light wave. These two descriptions are connected through entanglement itself, which is the inverse relationship between the spinning information and the traveling wave. The straight line between each pair of entangled cubits, one inside the singularity and one on the horizon, is described by the same relationship that produces time dilation. The square of the angular rate defines the curvature of that line. When you take its inverse, you recover the straight path of light. The balance where spin and projection flow together as one. Now imagine the quantum state vector as a single arrow spinning on a perfect light clock. The x direction and the y direction each represent the normalized speed of light. One plank length in one plank time. When the arrow leans toward x, its shadow shows how much of light's motion is encoded in that direction. The angle of the arrow is the proportion of light's velocity expressed in that moment. Nothing moves relative to empty space. Everything moves relative to light itself. Einstein taught that time slows. As motion approaches the speed of light, quantum information holography explains why. As the phase of the quantum state vector spins faster, the light clock tilts toward the horizon. In relativity, time dilation is written in terms of velocity compared to light speed. Here, velocity is replaced by angular frequency, the rate of rotation of the quantum state vector.
