is the origin of quantum gravity the black hole information Paradox solution and how to enhance Einstein's Vector tensor field into something called the quantum State Vector tensor field so I call this the universe's Quantum canvas painting with light and gravity so basically once upon a time in a cosmic scale in the vast expanse of the universe they whispered a Melody so profound and intricate that it connected the smallest particles to the vastest gxy this was the universe as envisioned by Quantum information holography a realm where the principles of quantum mechanics and general relativity danced in seamless Harmony in this universe every Star every drifting Comet every atom was more than a mere entity of mass and energy they were notes in an elaborate Symphony represented by Quantum State vectors these Quantum State vectors like etherial dancers carried the secrets of the cosmos detailing energy levels spin states and Quantum attributes in a language beyond the ordinary deep within this Cosmic dance lay The Familiar yet igma fabric of SpaceTime a canvas painted by Einstein's genius the quantum information holography has added a new dimension to this tapestry the curvature of SpaceTime which was once a solely geometric entity now pulses with the rhythm of quantum State vectors adding a Quantum depth to the classical arcs of gravity and time here in this heart of this Grand Cosmic ballet quum mechanics and general relativity Walt in perfect Unison velocity acceleration and gravity were redefined and the orientation of quantum State vectors in the quantum realm encode velocity and the rhythmic change mirrored the force of gravity so basically what I want to show you here is going to be a little bit math heavy here for a moment um is something called a Quantum State Vector tensor field and how entangled black holes emit something called the quantum State vector and that Quantum State Vector encodes velocity acceleration and probability so I'll erase this for now this is the black information box so basically what I'm going to show here is there in SpaceTime is composed of cubits and cubits are basically just these little plank hexagons and entangled black holes form when you have two photons of opposite spin on one uh plank area so if you think of the the universe like a like a movie where it's going from one picture frame to the next picture frame to the next picture frame and the universe is pulsing that something called plank time and plank time is the fastest time rate that exists in the universe in between plank time there when you can't see like uh the particles like it's going from one picture frame to the next uh there's a moment when the picture frame is off if you think of the universe similar to a movie uh camera or video there's a moment in between PL time where you can't observe any particles in that moment all particles are in super position and one of the potential uh possibilities is having two photons of opposite spin on one plank area when you have two photons of opposite spin on one plank area it collapses into an entangled black hole which is connected by a wormhole and then Hawking radiation uh interacts with the black holes and emits a Quantum State Vector so if you imagine we have a A Spacetime and it's composed of cubits a Quantum State Vector is just a little line of Hawking radiation that is one plank length long and it is emitted onto a a cubid the coine of that uh Hawking radiation or that Quantum State Vector that encodes velocity so if we have a a cubit here and this is a x- axis and we have our Y axis here and this is a 60° angle then the uh 60° angle in codes a velocity of 50% in other words cosine is just saying how far has this angle moved relative to the xaxis so if we have a beam of light going one plank length here and a beam of light going one plank length here even though they both gone the same distance in the same time this one will appear to be going half the speed of light in the X Direction so that's called the uh velocity component in the X Direction so if there's a 60° angle that means the velocity component in the X direction is C the speed of light times the cosine of theta that is the velocity component in the X Direction now on the Y AIS it would be just simply the Velocity in the y direction is equal to C * the S of theta the S of theta is just saying the same same thing as cosine it's just saying the percentage of the speed of light that the uh the Velocity in the y direction is encoded so now Leonard suskin who is the chair of Stanford physics uh he has uh published that when a Quantum State Vector is emitted the cosine squared of that Quantum State Vector gives you the probability that that Cubit will be in a spin up or a spin down state one moment later so he has added this uh this realm of of a probability to a Quantum State vector and one moment later now imagine again these Quantum State vectors are being emitted one plank time after another onto this uh grid structure of SpaceTime which is basically cubits if one moment later say this is the first little uh picture frame we'll call it a plank time one one moment later another quantum State Vector like plank time two just the next picture frame if that Quantum State Vector is emitted and it's emitted say at a 15° angle then that encodes the cosine of 15° is 86 so this encodes a velocity of 86% in the X Direction and this one Co a velocity of 50% that gives you a rate of change of velocity and acceleration by definition is uh uh equivalent to gravity and so or and acceleration is also the rate of change of velocity so once you have a rate of change of velocity then you are describing acceleration and acceleration as Einstein proved is equivalent to gravity so what we do with this at that point is we take our knowledge that we understand that by these Quantum State vectors encoding velocity relative to the speed of light and acceleration relative to the speed of light we are describing gravity and Einstein has something called a vector tensor field basically imagine it like you have this graph and and uh inside these little boxes imagine a piece of graph paper over SpaceTime there's these little arrows and they point in different directions and those arrows are describing the curvature of SpaceTime at that point and that just describes gravity but it doesn't describe quantum mechanics and so what we're I'm all I'm really doing is saying we're taking Leonard susin the chair of Stanford physics his saying that the quantum State Vector it's cosine squared describes the probability of the Cubit being spin up or spin down and we're adding that to Einstein's Vector tensor field and to this What I've Done Right Here showing that Einstein was completely correct but he didn't know what a cubeit was and he didn't know about this equation right here that if these are quantum State vectors they don't encode just curvature they encode curvature velocity acceleration and probability and so what we basically have done is we've taken Einstein's uh Vector tensor field and enhanced it to something called a Quantum State Vector tensor field that incorporates velocity acceleration uh curvature and probability and that Bridges uh quantum mechanics and relative ity and uh so that's just the basic rundown of how how we can we can do that enhance Einstein's Vector tensor field and these Quantum State vectors are being emitted from uh what are called uh plank Mass black holes and I won't go into how those form but but these Quantum State vectors ar
