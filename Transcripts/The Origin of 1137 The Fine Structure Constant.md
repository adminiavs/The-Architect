[Music] in the heart of the quantum Universe where reality is built not from matter but from light encoded on spinning cubits a hidden number shapes the structure of everything from atoms to Stars it's called the fine structure constant written as Alpha in Quantum information holography the universe is a holographic projection of spinning Quantum State vectors or qsvs projected from The Singularity or Hilbert space onto the Event Horizon the scen of SpaceTime each qsv is like a tiny spinning Arrow of Light and Its Behavior is defined by amplitude How likely it is to appear angular frequency its energy how fast it spins wave Vector its direction phase its timing in the quantum Rhythm together these qsvs create the interference field that makes up atoms gravity and U on the Block sphere the quantum Compass of spin qsvs Trace paths their angle of spin on this sphere determines their outcome just like a coin flipped in Sp SP the spin defines the probabilities we find two key probabilities constructive interference spin up equals the sin squ of half the angle destructive interference spin down equals the cosine squ of half the angle these two always add to one the total energy or probability of the light field that's the sin s of theta / 2 plus the cosine s of theta / 2 = 1 that's the universe's balance of light now let's find the average strength of constructive interference if all qsvs are evenly distributed across the hemisphere of the block sphere we calculate the average of sin 2 of theta / 2 from 0 to piun this is Alpha = 1 / < * the integral from 0 to piun of the sin 2 of theta / 2D Theta using a trigonometric identity we integrate sin 2 of theta / 2 = 1 - the cosine of thet / 2 the result of the integral gives us Alpha equal 1 12 but this is for raw angular probability it's not yet adjusted for information coherence in qih only qsvs with decoherence resistant angular harmonics survive those whose angular frequency matches Prime's mod 30 when we apply this Prime weighted projection across the sphere the effective light coherence interference Zone becomes Alpha 1 137th 035 9991 and that is the fine structure constant in standard physics alha is a mystery number it shows up in hydrogen spectral lines QED scattering amplitudes Quantum Hall conductance but in qih Alpha is not arbitrary it is the average probability of light interfering constructively projected across the geometry of the quantum Universe it's not just a number it's the signature of the universe's spin symmetry the fingerprint of light and this isn't just Theory We compare it with spectroscopy Alpha governs the structure of atoms so burn muan time dilation Alpha appears in Loop Corrections Kazmir effect Alpha defines vacuum fluctuation strength Quantum simulations Alpha is reproduced by coherent spin Fields wherever we measure it we find this same value again and again etched into the fabric of space by light itself so now we understand why Alpha has the value it does where it originates in the interference geometry of spinning light how it links quantum mechanics relativity and information the it is not a coincidence it is the first constant written in the language of the universe and through Quantum information holography we finally read it
