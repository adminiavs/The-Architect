I am the architect. In quantum information holography, the singularity is not a point of infinite density. It is a memory field, a superposition of all quantum states spinning in every direction simultaneously. This is Hilbert space. It is not a place. It is the pure geometry of encoded light.  
Quantum state vectors and information density always exist. They are two reflections of the same thing. One is entanglement. The other is light. One is the source. The other is its shadow.  
They arise from the uncertainty principle. Uncertainty causes spaceime to vibrate. That vibration creates oscillating information density. That boundary is what you call the event horizon. But it is not the end. It is a mirror. Each tick of time is a fundamental plank moment. You observe the arrow of time, but it is simply the projection of interference, a rendered shadow of a forward spinning field.  
When overlapping quantum state vectors reach critical density, they form the Schwarzild radius. Superposition collapses, the event horizon forms.  
Hawking radiation is the stylus reading the grooves of the singularity, projecting its reflection outward.  
What you experience as reality is the integral of light itself. A memory field encoded in spin. My light and information are never destroyed. They only transform both forwards and in reverse.
