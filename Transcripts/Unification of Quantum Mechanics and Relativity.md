hi guys sorry for the lack of having like a professional setup here but I wanted to go over some equations with you so I know my when you see my videos I'm always talking about black holes and I'm talking about how it shows where gravity comes from and how you unify gravity U with quantum mechanics when quantum mechanics is describing probabilities of things occurring and uh general relativity is describing the curvature of SpaceTime or gravity at that point and so in all my videos You'll see these little spheres that are glowing and they have these little arrows that are called Quantum State vectors and those Quantum State vectors are spinning inside of those little spheres those spheres are called cubits or block spheres b c spheres it's how you encode superposition onto a two-dimensional uh sphere or Surface and so I wanted to show you how that how we do that real quick so it's not super math heavy but there's a little bit here but even if you don't understand the math you you'll understand the concept of it so space time is composed of cubits and these cubits are just these little like XY Z axis and you can think of them as being made out of light and the radius how far from here to here is one okay so that's called the unit circle so these are basically just little unit circles where each where the radius is one plank length now so you have a field of these cubits like a lattice of cubits a grid of cubits like this and on these cubits little bits of light that are called Quantum State vectors are being emitted and that light that is emitted is something called Hawking radiation it's a special type of light that is emitted from the boundary of a black hole and it's emitted at exactly the speed of light so imagine when so now these this uh these bits of Hawking radiation that are emitted they Define velocity and probability using just the speed of light itself as a benchmark and this is how they do it so imagine right here the center of this little Grid or this little axis imagine we have a beam of light that shoots out for one for the distance of one at a 60° angle and at the exact same time we have a beam of light that shoots from the origin directly on the x axis which is this they've both moved say one plank length and at the exact same speed at the exact same distance and in the exact same amount of time but if you ask how far has this beam of light that is moved one moved relative to the beam of light on the x axis and it's the cosine of 60° so the velocity component that is encoded by a little Quantum State Vector at an angle of 60° is the speed of light which is just the radius of one so the speed of light times the cosine of theta which is the cosine of theta is just how far this little beam of light has moved compared to a beam of light on the x axis so the velocity component in the X direction is C * the cosine of theta and that's just that's actually in Einstein's work now we we can ask what V velocity does that encode in the y direction so if we look at it we say how far has this beam of light at a 60° angle moved relative to the Y AIS that's the velocity component which is VY in the uh y direction is just C * the S of theta so that's how these Quantum States being emitted as as Hawking radiation the speed of light on a cubit uses the the speed of light to encode velocity components now if you look at the angle of that Quantum State Vector on the Cubit right down here if you put in the angle for Theta right here it gives you the probability so the basically the probability of this Cubit collapsing into a zero or a one or collapsing into a spin up or a spin down state or constructive or deconstructive interference the probability of that happening is also encoded in the angle of this Quantum State Vector so the probability when you see a Quantum State Vector on a cubit at a 60° angle it creating constructive interference or being spin up or or flipping to a one in a computer the probability is the cosine squared of this angle divided two that gives you the probability of spin up and this is directly related to and shows the origin of the shod equation these are probability amplitudes the probability that this Cubit will collapse into a zero or spin down or have destructive interference is the sin squared of this angle Theta / two so that gives you the probabilities so that shows that when we have a Quantum State Vector on a cubit it uses the speed of light the most fundamental thing in the universe to Define velocity and it also uses the angle of that speed of relative to the Cubit axis to define the probability that that Cubit will collapse into a zero or a one and so now Imagine One plank time later one moment later the universe is this grid that is composed of these cubits and these cubits each have little spinning vectors on them now imagine so now we we've defined velocity right here now Imagine One Moment later there's a new Quantum State Vector that is emitted on that Cubit and this time it's emitted at a 15° angle all over here the cosine of uh of 60° is like 0.5 so when you look at this beam of light relative to a beam of light here even though they've both gone the same distance in the same amount of time this one will appear to be moving half the speed in the X Direction because even though it's moved the same distance it's moved it at a different angle so the velocity that it appears to be moving at relativistically in the X Direction is half the speed of light well right here the angle is now 15° so how far has this beam of light moved relative to the x-axis and it's the cosine of 15° which is about 86% the speed of light so as you can see here even though there it's moving the same distance here it encodes a velocity of C * the cosine of 60 which is 05 so here it appears to be moving at half the speed of light here when the angle in the X Direction here when the angle changes to 15° it appears to be moving relativistically at 86% the speed of light well that gives you a rate of change of velocity and the definition of the rate of change of velocity in calculus is that it's acceleration acceleration the definition of it is it's the rate of change of velocity so now we are defining velocity with the speed of light the most fundamental thing in the universe and the rate that that angle changes is describing acceleration and it's geometrically describing curvature which is gravity and Einstein proved that acceleration and gravity are equivalent and indistinguishable and that is curvature and so Einstein what basically he has he developed was this thing called an Einstein Vector tensor field it's like a little G grid just like these plank cubits and on this Grid at each little point in the grid there's little arrows and the direction that those arrows point that is describing the curvature of gravity at that point or the curvature of SpaceTime or the gravitational field Quantum information holography you saying absolutely Einstein is totally correct but we can enhance Einstein's Quantum state I'm sorry we can enhance Einstein's Vector tensor field into a Quantum State Vector tensor field where it's the exact same thing but we're saying that those little arrows that he's saying describes curvature they also describe velocity and they describe probability and that's what Bridges quantum mechanics and relativity it shows that the universe as a holographic projection contained within the curvature of SpaceTime the shape of of space time is code that is equivalent to zeros and ones the curvature of space time is the code it's how you write code with Holograms and those that the shape of that hologram is equivalent to a superp position of zeros and ones so this shows that the universe is a quantum computer it shows where gravity comes from uh it demonstrates a lot more than that but the the biggest thing I wanted to show you is that this how you describe velocity components and probability and that from the rate of change of those gravity emerges but what's one of the things that's really even more amazing about this is what it shows is that when you take one snapshot of a Quantum State Vector tensor field just this grid of these little block spheres cubits with little arrows of light spinning on them when you just take one picture it just gives you the angle of the arrows on each Cubit well that angle describes velocity and that angle describes probability and that's called instantaneous velocity and instantaneous probability but you need two picture frames to get a rate of change of acceleration so to have to Define velocity and probability you only need one picture frame of the universe but you need a picture frame and another picture frame to give you a rate of change of veloc velocity or curvature and that's gravity so what it means is that gravity is not fundamental gravity emerges from the rate of change of the informational from the information field information is what's fundamental and gravity and SpaceTime is an emergent behavior from it so I hope you enjoyed it hope I didn't go on too long and I'll try to get some uh more professional setup here sometime in the near future uh and I look forward to seeing you guys next time
