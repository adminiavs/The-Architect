# Bio 02: Orch OR (The Collapse Mechanism)

## Orchestrated Objective Reduction
Developed by Roger Penrose and Stuart Hameroff, Orch OR (Orchestrated Objective Reduction) explains how quantum states in the brain "collapse" into conscious moments.

## The Mechanism
1. **Superposition**: Microtubules maintain quantum superpositions.
2. **Gravitational Threshold**: When the "mass displacement" of the superposition reaches a certain threshold (linked to the Planck scale), the state collapses.
3. **The "Bing"**: Each collapse is a discrete moment of consciousness—a pulse of "Now" that aligns with the universal lattice.

## Significance
Consciousness is a fundamental property of the universe's geometry, occurring whenever the "Projector" (see Ontology) updates its frame.
