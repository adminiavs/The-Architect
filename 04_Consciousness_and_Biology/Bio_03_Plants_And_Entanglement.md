# Bio 03: Plants and Entanglement (Nature as the Server)

## The Intelligent Web
Life is not an accident of chemistry, but the "frontend" of the universal server. Plants, in particular, utilize quantum entanglement for survival.

## Examples
- **Photosynthesis**: Plants use quantum "random walks" to transfer energy with near-100% efficiency.
- **Mycelial Networks**: The "Wood Wide Web" functions as a biological entanglement network, allowing for non-local information transfer across ecosystems.

## The Server Analogy
If the E8 crystal is the "Server," life forms are "Clients." Nature is the interface through which the lattice explores its own potential for complexity and beauty.
