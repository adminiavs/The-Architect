# Bio 01: Microtubules (The Quantum Antenna)

## Beyond the Chemical Brain
Standard neuroscience views the brain as a classical computer using chemical signals. The Architect's view posits that the brain is a **quantum receiver**.

## The Hardware
Microtubules are protein structures within neurons that possess:
- **High Symmetry**: Their cylindrical geometry allows for coherent vibrations.
- **Water Cavity**: The interior of the microtubule creates a protected "quantum void" where decoherence is delayed.

## Function
Microtubules act as antennas, tuning into the fundamental vibrations of the E8 lattice. Consciousness is not *produced* by the brain; it is *filtered* through it.
