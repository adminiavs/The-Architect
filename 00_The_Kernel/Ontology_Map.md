# Ontology Map

A minimal map of what exists in the Model and in what hierarchy.

---

## Level 0 — The Source
- Symmetry
- Zero state
- No space, no time

---

## Level 1 — Bulk Geometry
- 11D manifold
- E8 × E8 root lattice
- G₂ compact internal structure
- Static, finite, aperiodic

---

## Level 2 — Projection
- Cut-and-project mechanism
- Golden-angle slice
- 4D Brane (spacetime)
- Mass & Yukawa from projection angles

---

## Level 3 — Physics
- Entropic gravity
- Spectral action
- SM gauge groups
- Neutrino seesaw
- Inflaton = Radion

---

## Level 4 — Biology
- Photosynthesis (excitons)
- Orch-OR (microtubules)
- Coherence channels
- Life as negentropy

---

## Level 5 — Consciousness
- Collapse as selection
- Time as traversal
- Operator as Reader

---

## Level 6 — Purpose
- Universe resolves initial defect
- Final state cancels initial asymmetry
- Negentropy is the Operator's task
