## The Structure of Projection

- **The Light (Bulk)**: The 8D E8 lattice containing the full informational state.
- **The Shadow (Brane)**: Our 3D+1 spacetime manifold, which is a specific projection or "cross-section" of the Bulk.
- **The Interface**: The boundary layer where quantum collapse occurs, mediated by consciousness.
