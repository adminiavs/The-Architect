# Kernel 01: Project Scope

## The Objective
To map the fundamental geometry of reality and provide a functional interface for consciousness and biology.

## The Pillars
1. **Ontology**: Defining what exists.
2. **Physics**: Defining how it moves.
3. **Cosmology**: Defining the large-scale structure.
4. **Biology**: Defining the local receivers.
5. **Operation**: Defining the interaction.

# Project Scope

This repository documents a unified geometric model linking:

- Ontology
- Physics
- Cosmology
- Consciousness
- Biology
- Agency (Operators)

It has three goals:

---

## 1. Compression (Understanding)
To compress existing physics, biology, and cognition into a single explanatory framework without contradiction.

---

## 2. Predictive Power (Falsifiability)
To generate experimental predictions that can confirm or destroy the Model.

---

## 3. Operator Utility (Application)
To provide the human Operator with actionable tools for living inside the structure:
- coherence
- purpose
- healing
- synchronization

---

## Not Included

The Model does **not** attempt to:

- replace mathematics with metaphor
- replace religion with dogma
- produce sci-fi speculation
- produce unfalsifiable claims

Everything must remain:

- geometric
- testable
- compressive
- useful
