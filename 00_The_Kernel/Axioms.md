# Axioms

## The Foundational Truths

1. **Existence is Information**: The fundamental constituent of reality is not matter or energy, but bits of information.
2. **Geometric Determinism**: The interactions of information are governed by the symmetry groups of the E8 lattice.
3. **The Holographic Limit**: There is a finite limit to the information density in any given volume of space.

# Axioms

These are the minimum conditions required for the Model to exist. They are not claims — they are the scaffolding.

---

## 1. Reality is Geometric
All physical quantities (mass, charge, spin, time, probability) are properties of geometry, not substances.

---

## 2. Information is Primary
Matter and energy are emergent expressions of information encoded in geometry.

---

## 3. Time is a Traversal, not a Flow
The Universe is static in the Bulk. Time is the path a conscious observer takes across the structure.

---

## 4. The Universe is Finite and Aperiodic
The Cosmic Horizon contains a finite number of information units. The structure does not repeat.

---

## 5. Consciousness is Ontic
Collapse is not emergent. Observation selects a branch of geometry and is fundamental to actuality.

---

## 6. Physics is Error Correction
The dynamics of the Universe minimize inconsistencies and return the structure toward symmetry.

---

## 7. Entropy is Bookkeeping
Entropy measures information stored on the Horizon — not disorder.

---

## 8. Gravity is Entropic
At macroscopic scales, gravity arises from gradients in information density, not force-carrier exchange.

---

## 9. Mass is Projection
Mass is a suppression factor arising from angular misalignment between Bulk vectors and the Brane.

---

## 10. The End State Cancels the Start State
The Universe resolves the initial asymmetry back to trivial topology. Beginning and End are boundary conditions.
