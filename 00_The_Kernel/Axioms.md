1. **Existence is Information**: The fundamental constituent of reality is not matter or energy, but bits of information.
2. **Geometric Determinism**: The interactions of information are governed by the symmetry groups of the E8 lattice.
3. **The Holographic Limit**: There is a finite limit to the information density in any given volume of space.
