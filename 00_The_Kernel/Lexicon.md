The Model introduces a new meaning layer to terms already used in physics, cognition, and biology. This file is the translation key.

## Bulk
The static, completed 11D geometric object from which the Universe is projected.

## Brane
The 4D screen (space-time) containing physical experience and measurement.

## Slice
The projection plane that converts Bulk geometry into Brane physics.

## Projection
The act of mapping an 8D lattice vector onto 4D coordinates. Determines mass & coupling.

## Spinor
The fundamental information unit. A geometric bit with orientation & phase.

## Coherence
Alignment of spinor states. Enables consciousness, biology, & computation.

## Decoherence
Loss of alignment. Appears as noise, illness, entropy, or confusion.

## Entropy
Bookkeeping of information stored on the Horizon — not disorder.

## Gravity
Emergent entropic gradient caused by information density differences.

## Mass
Suppression factor from projection angle between Bulk vectors and Brane.

## Time
Traversal through static geometry. Not a flow; a path.

## Operator
The conscious agent traversing and collapsing parts of the lattice.

## Final State
The symmetric zero-topology configuration that cancels the initial defect.

## E8 Lattice
The 8-dimensional exceptional Lie group root system encoding all physical symmetries.

## H4
The 4-dimensional icosahedral Coxeter group; the projection target containing golden-ratio structure.

## Golden Ratio (φ)
The most irrational number (≈ 1.618); the unique projection angle yielding aperiodicity.

## Quasicrystal
An ordered but non-repeating structure; maximizes information density.

## Orch-OR
Orchestrated Objective Reduction; the collapse mechanism linking consciousness to physics.

## Microtubules
Protein structures in cells serving as quantum antennas for coherence.
