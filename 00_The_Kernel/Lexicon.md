## Key Terms of the Architect's Engine

- **E8 Lattice**: The fundamental 8-dimensional geometric structure from which our 3D reality is projected.
- **The Projector**: The mechanism of consciousness and field dynamics that translates higher-dimensional information into perceptual reality.
- **Coherence**: A state of structural and informational alignment with the fundamental lattice.
- **Decoherence**: The breakdown of informational order into noise.
- **The Block Universe**: The 4D spacetime structure where all events exist statically.

# Lexicon

The Model introduces a new meaning layer to terms already used in physics, cognition, and biology. This file is the translation key.

## Bulk
The static, completed 11D geometric object from which the Universe is projected.

## Brane
The 4D screen (space-time) containing physical experience and measurement.

## Slice
The projection plane that converts Bulk geometry into Brane physics.

## Projection
The act of mapping an 8D lattice vector onto 4D coordinates. Determines mass & coupling.

## Spinor
The fundamental information unit. A geometric bit with orientation & phase.

## Coherence
Alignment of spinor states. Enables consciousness, biology, & computation.

## Decoherence
Loss of alignment. Appears as noise, illness, entropy, or confusion.

## Entropy
Bookkeeping of information stored on the Horizon. Not disorder.

## Gravity
Emergent entropic gradient caused by information density differences.

## Mass
Suppression factor from projection angle between Bulk vectors and Brane.

## Time
Traversal through static geometry. Not a flow; a path.

## Operator
The conscious agent traversing and collapsing parts of the lattice.

## Final State
The symmetric zero-topology configuration that cancels the initial defect.
